Astrobotic Technology is\r\nan American privately held company that is developing space robotics technology for lunar\r\nand planetary missions. It was founded in 2007 by Carnegie Mellon professor Red Whittaker\r\nand his associates, with the goal of winning the Google Lunar X Prize. More than a decade\r\nlater Astrobotic became the largest NASA contractor with government funding of more than\r\n$200M.\r\n- Our main goal with this partnership is to promote cryptocurrencies worldwide, once again\r\npushing boundaries in terms of crazy marketing ideas. We strongly believe this is the\r\nmost effective way to popularize this technology and we want to be a leader of this\r\nchange.\r\n- We are about to send a certain amount of $SUPERBID tokens to the moon surface on a\r\ndevice, which is a hardware wallet for storing all types of cryptocurrencies. On top of\r\nthat, we want to connect the campaign with our current and future base of influencers, to\r\ncreate a viral movement. The details will be disclosed in the coming weeks, as we see\r\nthis partnership as a long-term activation.\r\n- Astrobotic will not only help Superbid send tokens to the Moon surface, but also be the\r\nfirst official corporate partner, who will hold auctions on our platform. Do you want to feel\r\nlike a space engineer for one day? Here you go…\r\nOverall, this partnership is beneficial for SuperBid for 3 main reasons:\r\n- 1. It helps propel our mission of taking cryptocurrencies into the mainstream even\r\nfurther. By partnering with a government contractor, we are getting closer to affecting\r\npositive, crypto related change on a global level. There is plenty of attention already\r\naround cryptocurrencies going to the moon, and we are actually the ones doing it for\r\nreal.\r\n- 2. Holders of the $SUPERBID token are in for a unique opportunity in the future, where\r\nthey will be able to engage with Astrobotic and our mission to the moon. The details of this will be released soon, and it will be an incredible event to be a part of. We will have\r\na system to check how many tokens are in your wallet, and you will be able to participate\r\nin tiers of this activity based on your balance.\r\n- 3. As a long term partner with Astrobotic, we will not only be taking cryptocurrencies into the mainstream but also they will be utilizing our app for running their own auctions as our first corporate auction partner. Do you want to live a day in the life of a rocket engineer, or even watch a rocket launch yourself?

No matter how big the data storage solution is, it still remains vulnerable to attacks. The issue with relying on such a solution is that attackers \\*only\\* have to break the defences of one data storage entity to compromise it.\r  \n\r  \nDecentralized solutions work differently. To put it simply: data is encrypted and stored across several locations. \r  \n\r  \nIf you’ve hung around Crypto Twitter (CT), you might have witnessed a huge number of cyber attacks on crypto protocols. In 2021 only protocols have lost billions of dollars in hacks & scam. This is why it’s important for web3 apps to build on decentralized infrastructures such as Point Network that facilitate storing data on decentralized storage solutions. \r  \n\r  \nIf you need additional reasons for going for decentralization, consider that centralized entities can decide to halt providing services any time they want… Just look at what happened to the Parler app last year, and you’ll understand that centralized entities have become way bigger than we should have let them.', ""Some auto companies has been exploring blockchain and how it will benefit them better than centralized systems. BMW has tested blockchain to track the mileage of leased vehicles. They also in collaboration with GM explore sharing of self-driving cars data.\n\nAndre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk:\n\n*“With the advent of blockchain, decentralized data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way. Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.”*\n\nSebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI’s vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:\n\n*“The old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.”*\n\nThey'll be exploring this through Ocean Protocol, which is also a member of MOBI."", 'Because the attacker only need to infiltrate one storage facility compare that to decentralized storage where even if one storage point is compromised, you have other facilities to fact check the data and use as a reference to restore the compromised one.', 'Storage on the decentralized platform is secure and everlasting. It also does not necessitate a large investment in data centers, making it less expensive than centralized storage solutions. Controlling and storing functions are simple, especially when employing storage platforms such as OCEAN, FIL, and AR.', ""The protocols for decentralized storage generally make it easy for smaller providers to provide a good service. IPFS is an easy one to play with if you're interested in learning more."", ""Consider the benefits of a single centralised database. Just a single MySQL or MariaDB server hosting all your data. What metrics could you measure it by?\n\n- speed\n- security\n- resistance to failure\n- capacity\n\nA single server will be our reference point, so let's say it scores 1 unit on all of these categories. The scale is entirely arbitrary but will be useful as a benchmark.\n\nNow, presume we have two identical servers running in parallel that somehow synchronise with each other. In that case, we compromise a bit on speed, since we are using some amount of time to synchronise, and you cannot process at a speed greater than 1 unit, because in that case, they will never be able to catch up and synchronise. In addition, you also compromise on capacity, since you are using (and paying for!) enough disk space to store 2 units, but you can only store 1 unit (maybe even less due to synchronisation overhead) because you have one copy of the same data on each server. You do, however, have a system that is twice as reliable, since two servers need to crash for your system to go down, instead of just one.\n\nNow consider four servers. The speed goes down a little bit again due to synchronisation overhead, but maybe not as much of a penalty as going from 1 server to 2 servers. Capacity also decreases from ½ to ¼, since you are now maintaining four copies of the same data. But now, your system is extremely reliable, and it's unlikely that it's going to ever go down if your four servers are located around the world. You also get an increase in security, since if the data on one server is tampered with, it becomes immediately obvious since the other three won't agree with it. An adversary would need to tamper with the data on at least two servers now to confuse the system.\n\nA blockchain is like scaling this system to a million servers. Eventually, the penalty for adding new servers in terms of cost to speed bottoms out. The blockchain *is* a way to synchronise unlimited servers with each other. It's also impossible to tamper with. Nobody can modify the data on one, ten, or even a hundred thousand servers without it being rejected overall by the remaining 900,000. You also get a benefit where every action is cryptographically signed, but that is not an intrinsic benefit of the blockchain. Rather, every cryptocurrency has just independently found it useful to implement such a feature.\n\nThe downsides remain the same. The Ethereum network is only capable of handling around ten transactions per second, an abysmal speed compared to a single MySQL server which can execute thousands of queries a second even on unimpressive hardware. Additionally, every Ethereum node maintainer keeps a 300+ GB copy of the blockchain, which actually only ends up containing maybe around 50 GB of actual data if it was stored in an optimally efficient manner, without a blockchain. So at the end of the day, you have 300+ PB of hard disk space around the world being used to store duplicate data. But since every node maintainer pays their own costs, the pain is spread so widely that it really doesn't matter as much.\n\nEdit: There is also a downside specific to Ethereum and cryptocurrency blockchains. The network charges you a fee (gas fee) to modify the data, and this can cost into the order of several dollars per update. Even at its cheapest on side chains, it's still upwards of a penny per dozen or so updates. That's hellishly expensive compared to centralised solutions."", 'company can easily ban you and delete all your content.', ""It all boils down to the fact that you don't own your data and you cannot really guarantee privacy.

Web3 is gonna be hitting on everything now. I believe the growth and the impact of web3 will be unmatched to be honest, especially with the amount of money that's being poured into this space and how investments are being made. BitDAO is the perfect example as it's allocating millions of dollars to invest in web3, this is a simple example of what's about to happen"", 'Literally the largest social media/big tech corporation (Facebook) changing its name to Meta. Zuck All in on Web 3.0. This is only one reason of many. The technologies alone, if you understand the technical aspects of it, should be also a reason to invest in it while it’s early. It’s not a matter of “if” Web 3.0 is gonna explode, it’s a matter of “when”. \n\nEdit: I will add, to be fair, The single and only major downside I see of Web 3.0 is the decentralization part, since big tech corporations depend on centralized systems to keep being “big tech” hence no competition, (how it is rn). (I think that’s what Zuck is doing and trying to monopolize web3.0 so that’s why i don’t agree with the whole “meta” concept because it goes against the decentralization values. So with the Great Reset and all these other giant corporations trying to make us more and more centralized and authoritarian, I find it hard that they will let a “truly” decentralized system exist without them having control of it. Yes, they can tax it and whatever but at the end of they day they will want the control, just how it is right now, but adapting it to Web 3.0, kinda like making a social credit system and a crypto as our “funds”. It gets kinda dystopian if you get into the rabbit whole of how politics and power affect our every day life so I view decentralized web3.0 as a hope of true freedom and almost as a “resistance” to controlling governments. \n\nAfter all, we all give the value to the cryptos, and don’t have to go back to fiat if we are all in accordance to it having an absolute value; hence them not even getting $$$ from taxes (preferably with a stable coin). (Kinda how in apocalyptic video games and movies ppl use bottle caps or specific items as a “coin” to not depends on solely trading.)\n\nWhat do you think?', ""I 100% agree with you on the meta concept. But i believe that there is no way the government is going to allow a free and decentralized web. Maybe we'll get lucky and a 2nd internet could be split off from the main net but i think even that is highly unlikely. The government and public companies are in too deep to allow the people control"", 'Agreed. \n\nWell even web3.0 through government control still will be a thing so there that for its “potential” you didn’t seem to find.']"
