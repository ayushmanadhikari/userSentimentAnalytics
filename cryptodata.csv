Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.,"I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model.

S W token 💰 $500k mcap 📈 2600 holders 🤚deflationary 🔻 CMC listing just approved 🚀,"

This is a coin I am genuinely passionate about and have been in from near enough day one – the telegram community that has developed around it has to be one of the most tight knit I have experienced, and it is exciting that we are adding new members every day.  It has certainly been a rollercoaster journey so far and I am not promising a smooth journey, but I personally believe any investor getting in now will be very pleased long term.   

  

To summarise, I feel this coin, with such a low market cap and with the ambition the developers have shown, is primed to moon 🌕

  

The most exciting thing is that we found out yesterday that the coin was approved for Coin Market Cap listing 📈📈(searchable and can be added to watch list). This has been a huge goal for the developers and anyone getting in before the listing goes live (once we hit the required daily volume and marketcap) we will be there for everyone to see. We also saw the price go x10 when we went live on Coin Gecko a few weeks ago and Coin Market Cap is much larger. 

  

We have also begun to see some real exposure with various youtubers covering us with many having over 100,000 subscribers. Here is one review: 

  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xILwbCnMwA&pbjreload=101&ab_channel=CryptoPablo 

  

Highlights: 

*       879b total supply 💰

  

*      $500k Marketcap 💸

  

*        121b burned so far 🔥

  

*      LP locked 🔐

  

*      3600 holders 🙎‍♂️
  

*      Deflationary tokenomics 🔻

  

*   1% burn rate 🔥

  

*   2% tax rate (used for expenses such as marketing) 💰

  

*      Code Locked for safety of investors 👍

  

*      On poocoin’s new trending page 💩

  

*   Marketing campaign begun today (background)📺

 

*       Coin Gecko Listed 📈


*       1.8k telegram community 📲

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upcoming updates:

* Coin Market Cap listing APPROVED and live any day 🚀

*  Detailed White Paper released by Monday 📝

* Revamped website by Monday 🌐

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here is the roadmap: 

A 4-Year plan: 

  

2021: 

- Organic Growth 

- Marketing Campaign 

- Digital Marketplace 

- Community Platform 

  

2022: 

- A startup company 

- First summer party (aka meet the team) 

- First Project Election 

- First Project Purchase 

  

2023: 

- Investment tour 

- Our own exchange 

- Offices in multiple countries 

  

2024: 

- 1M+ Holders 

- 1B+ annual transactions 

- 10B+ Market cap 

- 12+ Digital Platforms 

  

As you can see they have grounded yet ambitious targets.

A coin I have been in since the stealth launch which was ruined by whale & bot buyers and bad actors manufacturing a crash. We became a small community of core holders and have helped grow the coin since through spreading the word and holding strong with others seemed to not believe. The devs have worked tirelessly to deliver for the community and I firmly believe this has an extremely bright future and I can’t believe how early it is still. 

  

There was naturally some initial FUD spread by bad actors around the coin but the team have vastly addressed these issues and gone out of their way to appease the community with decreasing the tax and locking the code whilst also delivering some huge announcements.

I found this coin randomly on a reddit post and have become fully involved in the telegram community and have never quite experienced such a tight knit group after such a short period. It was definitely a bumpy start with whales and bots buying up a lot of the coin after a soft launch and there being a dump by them from an all-time high market cap of $2.5 million. The community rebuilt from a lowly market cap of $7k as nothing had really changed but a few bad actors spreading FUD and the community has gone from strength to strength with the developers consistently surprising us by listening to our ideas and suggestions. I have been constantly adding to my amount after buying in a small amount when the token first took off and I personally see a big future. I am really excited about what the future holds for S W and it is evident from the people in the community that they really want it to grow and prosper. It still feels so early and at times feels like the best kept secret in crypto for me with only a market cap of $230k and holders at 2100. I regularly see meme coins with no utility or serious intentions hit market caps in the millions. It definitely has taken patience with this coin and mental steel holding through jumps to $600k + twice from coin gecko listing and other catalysts but what was promising to see was almost all the top wallets haven’t sold  throughout and are if anything adding.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long term there are plans such as:
 
+ Community decided purchases
+ Building own exchange
+ Social platform

WIN: The reference for lottery tokens in the crypto sphere. A coin that already has a use-case! [0$ Market Cap],"**The project:** 

WIN ($TICKETS) aspires to become the most commonly known and recognized lottery token in the crypto sphere. In order for a cryptocurrency to grow and gain traction, especially in the Altcoin market, it must have a ‘use-case’, which only usually comes with the promise of a better future. Our team is motivated by the idea our coin will have a use-case from day one! The gambling industry has been around for centuries, and there will be an ever-growing crowd of ‘gamblers’ and players in the crypto world, as cryptocurrencies slowly become the staple in terms of money transactions around the world. In order to support this transition, WIN wishes to establish itself as the most competitive and well-known lottery token in the industry, all the while progressively growing a following. 

**How it works:**

With WIN, the chances of winning are relative to how many tokens you hold, which means that all holders are incentivized to buy more tokens in the long term if they wish to increase their chances of winning the lottery. 

In addition, the requirement to be eligible at winning the lottery is relatively low, at the value of 777,777 tokens, which means all holders are incentivized to HODL in the hopes of winning a huge prize. 

Chances of winning will be calculated in indirect proportion to how many tokens each holder has. This means that having more tokens does increase your chances of winning, but not in a linear fashion. Instead, a logarithmic function will be used to convert the proportion of holdings that each investor has, and calculate their chances of winning accordingly. 

This will lower the discrepancy in the probability of winning between a whale and a small investor while keeping our larger investors at an advantage. 

**A note on marketing:**

In the framework of the gambling industry, marketing plays a key driver for all the parties involved. For the organization, marketing attracts a larger pool of players who can participate in the activities/lotteries. For the players, as more players are participating in the lotteries, this results in larger payouts being handed out. Since gambling is a high-risk, high reward activity, it is vital that a sufficient number of individuals are made aware of the present games in order to diversify the risks amongst the population of players.

In the case of WIN, the same applies, but with greater flexibility. Our ability to attract crypto investors as well as ‘gamblers’ increases the impact of our marketing, but this is unfortunately counterbalanced by the fact that we need to spend on marketing on a daily basis, for the aforementioned reasons. In order for our venture to be successful in the long term, WIN needs a constant marketing push, which imposes a marketing expense as part of the prize wallet. The complete breakdown of how this is executed is given in the whitepaper on the WIN website. 

**Launch**

This coin is launching on Sunday, after hosting a private sale on Friday and a pre-sale on Saturday. With the current level of effort and transparency put into this project, this could be the next very big thing.

Cryptoz 🚀 ($CRT) l launchpad platform for Microcap Projects l Be part of community l 100x potential | presale 16th June 2pm UTC,"I came across this project and looks very promising. Main feature is launchpad platform for small project.

It’s basically a Deflationary Token on BSC with ultra-fast yield generation, $CRT protocol is a community driven token and Launchpad Provider.

$CRT apples 7% TAX on all transaction. and the fees are proportionally split and instantly distributed as rewards among all token holders.

&#x200B;

✔️ Strong team 

✔️ Active team and community 

✔️ Anti whale functionality 

✔️ Holders will be whitelist on first IDO 

✔️ Strong Road map 

✔️ Huge marketing plans 

&#x200B;

Why is Cryptoz launchpad? Meme/Microcap Launchpad necessary?

Currently, there is a void in the market for launchpads supporting smaller projects. Micro-cap projects include meme coins, small raises/launches and charity coins. If these projects were to approach a traditional launchpad, they would most likely be rejected due to small size and lack of allocation for the launchpads themselves. Cryptoz allows these projects to raise their liquidity for LP in a fast turnaround time, while enjoying all the benefits of a traditional launchpad.

&#x200B;

🎯 Total supply: 1 trillion (deflationary)

🎯 No Team Fund. Only 4% tokens of the total supply will be kept aside for marketing initiatives.

What is Sphynx Network ?

\- Sphynx Network is using alchemy in blockchain technology so that staking  one NFT, one time only, will bring multiple rewards from different platforms simultaneously! ⚗️⚗️⚗️

\-> Sphynx Network is a decentralized token built on BSC network, using BEP20 standard and Solidity, audited and secured by professionals.  #BSC

\-> Sphynx Network aims to deliver a working product as a PVP and PVE combat platform, where NFTs are minted with different elementals (psychic, light, sound, air, fire, water, earth  and attributes (rarity, age, natural ability, active score, armor and weapon score, fame score, magical item score, agility charisma stamina, intellect, strength, etc) where users will fight for $SPH and BNB

&#x200B;

What makes SPH different ?

&#x200B;

\-> NFTs Will make Staking More Dynamic and Flexible by Implementing the Transferable Function That Unties the LP Stake From the User's Account. Staking Will be Linked to a Transferable NFT! 

\-> When staking with Sphynx Network, you will no longer need to unstake your assets if you want to stop staking, you can simply delegate a percentage of your stake from the NFT to an exchange and place a sell order!

\-> Sphynx Network will create a secondary market for the already staked tokens and when you are done staking, you can just go in the market and sell your NFT, since all the details will be stored in there, instead of unstaking and sell after.

What is the advantage of decentralized storage over centralized storage?," I don’t get the fuss over decentralized infrastructures. Take storage… as a company, I’d rather trust a big corporation to store my data than a decentralized solution involving several smaller little-known entities to store them. I guess I’m missing something here?",Elemiadlikefe,web3,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/x79gnu/what_is_the_advantage_of_decentralized_storage/,1662467664.0,29,231,2,"['I get your point, but there remains a critical flaw in this way of thinking. No matter how big the data storage solution is, it still remains vulnerable to attacks. The issue with relying on such a solution is that attackers \\*only\\* have to break the defences of one data storage entity to compromise it.\r  \n\r  \nDecentralized solutions work differently. To put it simply: data is encrypted and stored across several locations. \r  \n\r  \nIf you’ve hung around Crypto Twitter (CT), you might have witnessed a huge number of cyber attacks on crypto protocols. In 2021 only protocols have lost billions of dollars in hacks & scam. This is why it’s important for web3 apps to build on decentralized infrastructures such as Point Network that facilitate storing data on decentralized storage solutions. \r  \n\r  \nIf you need additional reasons for going for decentralization, consider that centralized entities can decide to halt providing services any time they want… Just look at what happened to the Parler app last year, and you’ll understand that centralized entities have become way bigger than we should have let them.', ""Some auto companies has been exploring blockchain and how it will benefit them better than centralized systems. BMW has tested blockchain to track the mileage of leased vehicles. They also in collaboration with GM explore sharing of self-driving cars data.\n\nAndre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk:\n\n*“With the advent of blockchain, decentralized data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way. Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.”*\n\nSebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI’s vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:\n\n*“The old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.”*\n\nThey'll be exploring this through Ocean Protocol, which is also a member of MOBI.""]"

I’ve seen a lot of web3 projects fall apart and some of them were not 100% secure.

Out of the countless projects there, I am bullish on Point Network. It’s a fully decentralized network that plans to decentralize the whole Internet.  I really like how transparent these guys are. I am excited about all of their upcoming flagship dApps. I can already imagine the web3 future with such a network...', ""Just like every emerging trend/tech, Web3 is still at it's infancy but that's not to undermine the insanely amount of progress already made by projects like ETH, The Graph, OCEAN Protocol, FIL and so on.\n\nFunnily Jack Dorsey has been promoting Web5 ahead of Web3 but I have to say that Web3 is here to stay.""]"

They claim to be the first network that decentralizes everything, and they don’t allow you to open any centralized domain on their [Point browser](https://pointnetwork.io/), like your Facebook and stuff. So bullish on this project, hopefully, this would be resistant to censorship and make the internet more secure for all of us.', 'The situation is confusing for me atm. Many hacks are happening.
