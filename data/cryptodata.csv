Basically it's the technological answer to the hierarchical structure of systems that have long made up a large part of our world. There is not one person or organization that owns the system. The system us based on a open sourcecode. Anyone can build apps on the system. \n\nWe're all very excited today because a large number of organizations have publicly stated to back the ethereum ecosystem. This has had a very positive impact on the long term confidence and has made the price rise quite substantially.\n\nBy using ethereum you can make contracts between people without the use of middleman. Those contracts are then enforced by a global computer. This has huge impact on how organizations will function, how people can trust the organizations that are running the world.\n\nGoing from hundreds of years of using a pyramid model of power to a flat, transparent and secure trust-able model is something we really need in the world right now.\n\nThe people in this thread are traders of the so called ether that fuels the system. We've all been here for different reasons. Since it's a traders sub, speculation and profit making is one of the reasons. But i'd like to think we all feel a certain pull towards the platform because we feel this can really impact the world in a positive way.\n\nCongrats to the holders and feel free to add info to people new to the concept of decentralized systems. Also, ask away if you need more info to grasp these idea's. This community is very helpful. One can also visit https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereumnoobies/ to start your path in the digital rabithole."", ""I hope this doesn't get lost in the middle of all the moon comments and excitement, but here's a slightly more serious post. Food for thought:\n\n- Stop being so greedy. \n\nRemember that this is a fairly risky investment (it doesn't feel like it because we are in a super bull market). Are you okay with losing 50% of your investment? Are you okay with losing 80% of it? Even if you think so, know that people vastly overestimate their ability to handle downturns. \n\nNo matter what you do, make sure that there will still be food on the table if eth goes to 0. \n\n- Stop watching the damn charts and hold\n\nGet out there and enjoy life. I'm a hypocrite because I spent more time on this sub than I've spent at work today, but the price will swing up or down whether you watch the charts or not. I bet most of you aren't actually trading - but you're glued to the charts due to all the excitement from eth taking off--but hey, you and I both knew it would take off. \n\nLASTLY, and by far the most important... \n\n- Family, friends, loved ones should be the top priority in your life. \n\nIf you're neglecting them and prioritizing staring at the price of ether, your priorities are should be recalibrated.

Lately, we‚Äôve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn‚Äôt lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn‚Äôt different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn‚Äôt mean that he is on your side. He isn‚Äôt helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you‚Äôre laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn‚Äôt same as you or me, he doesn‚Äôt have to save money for food, he doesn‚Äôt have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn‚Äôt on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn‚Äôt mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn‚Äôt be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn‚Äôt making him a proper role model.

A wallet is not what you think it is,"If you're new to the space, here is a quick 101 on wallets.

Metamask, Electrum, MEW, Trust, Coinomi, Atomic or whatever other application you call a wallet is not really a wallet.

They are **wallet applications** that allow you to access and manage your cryptocurrency, NFTs or whatever blockchain asset you have stored in your wallet.

**Your wallet is your private key or seed phrase.**

For example:

* You download Metamask
* It gives you the option to create a seed phrase/private key
* The same seed phrase you can import to other applications like Trust, MEW, Atomic and your ETH will be accessible on both Metamask and those applications.

So next time you download a new wallet application, you don't have to create a new seed phrase, you can just import the one you already have to manage your existing funds in both applications.

Just thought I'd share this since I work in crypto and I noticed that a lot of users don't know this.

EDIT: I felt obliged to add that this is the reason you should never ever share your private keys with anyone. Your keys are your sole access to your assets on the blockchain so keep them secure.

I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday. The scammers didn't like that and bought downvotes to make my post invisible. So this is an even more detailed post about them.,"Yesterday I made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about OpisHub. It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.

Then one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:

* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)
* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project
* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes

So even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:

* they use your phone's CPU for mining
* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what ""scientific research"" they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse
* ""each transaction gives a small % to charity""
* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees
* ""our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place"", so it's officially a pyramid scheme
* the token (and app) will launch soon ‚Ñ¢

Scammer 1 had also told me they ""have received ¬£3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground"". If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem ""sciency"" but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the ""initial contact"", which I think is hilarious.

So again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached.

Even if it takes years and I‚Äôm all aboard the doge train now.', 'YOU ARE USING MARKET CAP INCORRECTLY. \nChanging the market DOES NOT change the price.\n\nYOU CANNOT USE MARKET CAP AS A WAY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PRICE WILL BE - You can‚Äôt do that because the market cap IS what the value of the total supply is at the current cost. \n\nYOU CANT CHANGE ADD OR DECREASE MARKET CAP TO GET A DIFFERENT VALUE - you can only change the price and supply. \n\nALSO MARKET CAP DOES NOT = DOLLARS IN THE SYSTEM\n\nYou‚Äôre also not understanding how little supply increase actually affects things. The supply of Dogecoin is NOT infinite. to have an infinite supply you need infinite time. It take 24 YEARS for the supply of Dogecoin to double.\n\nThe price and supply change the market cap - completely different. \n\n\n\nEconomically speaking Dogecoin can rise to whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise. \n\nI will take your point and explain it correctly. \n\nI also see people asking what‚Äôs stopping Dogecoin from going to bitcoin levels? Well, The short answer is the supply of Dogecoin is high relative to the supply of bitcoin. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high.  It doesn‚Äôt mean that Dogecoin can‚Äôt rise in price - just that it‚Äôs harder. \n\nThis is the long answer.\nFirst, It is important to note that demand does not necessarily equate to adding dollars to the system in 1 to 1 ratio. Demand can increase without ever having to add money into the system, however, adding new money into the system does help. I see people saying Dogecoin requires X million dollars per minute to account for the increase in supply. That is just completely wrong, and not how demand works. Increased Demand just means more people willing to trade Dogecoin at a higher price than people willing to trade at the current price. No net increase in fiat currency needs to be added in order for demand to increase. \n\nDespite not having a capped supply, using the current supply known, as well as the mining rate to account for new coins entering - you can make comparisons to other cryptocurrency to get an idea of the demand required in order for Dogecoin to reach a certain price.  The way to do this is through market cap comparisons \n\nMathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply\nMC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)\n\nBefore moving forward, I want to explain market cap and the misconceptions behind its as well as how to correctly use it. \n\nMarket cap just means how much the total supply is ‚Äúvalued/worth‚Äù at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.\nI see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $X billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.\n\nTHAT‚ÄôS NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.\n\n*MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there‚Äôs 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is ‚Äúworth‚Äù 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that. Market cap is a comparison tool that I use in this example to show how Dogecoin would look at each price point*\n\nSimply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap. \n\nMarket caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It‚Äôs used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. \n\nIf Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be ‚Äúworth‚Äù about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. \n\nThe take away from this comparison is that in order to reach $1 Dogecoin would require approximately 1/7th the current demand of bitcoin due to the differences in supply between Dogecoin and bitcoin. This is definitely not impossible, and an achievable goal. If Dogecoin were to reach the demand bitcoin has currently - its price would $7. Since bitcoin is the highest performing cryptocurrency, $7 dollars is the most realistic possible goal at current market conditions. Anything past $7 dollars per coin means that Dogecoin is reaching uncharted territory for cryptocurrency as it will have surpassed bitcoin.\n\nNow for the hypothetical extension of this comparison. Everything after this point is hypothetical since we don‚Äôt have a true comparison available in the market\n\nThe estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).\n\nThis is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world‚Äôs short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn‚Äôt even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It‚Äôs not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point.

Not every new coin is a shitcoin: How to spot the real GEMS inside the sea of shitcoins.,"A few days ago, I made a post titled *""Rugpulls and Honeypots. What they are and how you can avoid them.""* Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here. If you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money.

Before I start, some background: I trade small coins for a living. In the beginning, while learning, I fell for all the scams just like everyone else. But with every loss I learned something new and I'm now pretty good at it. Yes, I have losses like everyone else, but usually I get out with very small losses compared to my gains.

Anyone here hating shitcoins, I agree with you. **I hate shitcoins too.** Part of what I want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. Every coin has to start with 0 holders. Everyone has to start somewhere. And every solid project deserves a chance to grow. Yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but I want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins.

# The Golden Rules

If you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. 

1. Start trading on the BSC (Binance) Smart Chain. Why? Transactions cost around $0.20 max. You can't do this on the ETH chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. I know they came down, but they're still too high.
2. For the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. I am not joking. Yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me.
3. Have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. Be prepared to lose your small bag completely. If you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it.

**Ready? Let's start:**

# Find the Coins

Go to the BscScan website (look up the links yourself, I don't want to link-spam this post). Then, go to ""View BEP-20 Transfers"". If the list looks confusing, don't worry. Look at the rightmost column that says ""Tokens"". You must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. Why? Because that means the coin is new. Established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. You can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones.

Open the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. So, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate.

# 1. Holders

On the page you just opened, look at the ""Holders"" list. The biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as ""PancakeSwap: COIN NAME"" and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as ""0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"". Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.

Also watch out if there are too many whales. For example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. Abort immediately. A healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. If it doesn't, also abort immediately.

# 2. Liquidity Pool

The liquidity pool is super important. I usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. Why? Because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. Again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. A locked liquidity pool is also important. Make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. You don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. You can copy the contract ID and then go to ""PooCoin"" (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract URL there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like ""COIN/BNB LP BNB Holdings:"". That's where you want at least $30k or more. If it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately.

# 3. Volume

Look at the ""Transfers"" section. If the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. If you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. You may have just been too early. If it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. It's not taking off yet. A good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute.

# 4. Website & Twitter

Make sure the coin has a website and twitter account. If it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. If it also has a reddit page, a Telegram channel, a Discord, an Instagram page, a YouTube channel, etc. that's even better.

# 5. Coin Name & Design

The logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. If it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. If the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. The name is also super important. If it has a catchy name like ""Save The World"" it's much more likely to take off than ""Funky Toilet Coin 55"".

# 6. Bonus: Doxxed Team

This one is a HUGE bonus. If the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through YouTube videos or live AMA, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. Why? Because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison.

# That's it!

Did the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? I cannot stress this enough, but: ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't invest in it. You will end up losing your money.

Did the coin pass all of the above steps? Great! You ***might*** have found a gem. Do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. Remember, things like hodling to get more coins or ""to the moon!"" are not real purposes.

And now we go back to the golden rules. If you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. I cannot stress this enough. You are learning and you will make mistakes. Make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. If you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. I easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. Sometimes I got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere.

Once you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation).

Two more important things to remember:

1. Early coins take time to take off. It's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. It may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. That's absolutely normal.
2. Keep track of what the team is doing during this time. If there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. A good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc). It's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag.

I **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and I currently have success with 90-95% of coins that I invest in. Trust me, **I tried to skip some of the rules above and I got burned every time**. Yes, it's a lot of work. Especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. If you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute.

"If someone is screaming ""Hold The Line"" they really mean ""Prop up the price so I can get out too""","As the title really. If someone is screaming at you and calling you out for selling they are not doing this because they are worried about your gains. They are worried about their own, they bought high and need the price up to recoup their losses.

Someone in profit quietly takes their gains and walks away, or quietly rides it out.

Someone who believes in the project will ride it out too, they will understand you taking profits, they will be confident someone else will buy in. They will generally behave in an encouraging manner.

People doing the shouting are usually bag holders, this all may be obvious to most of you, but for some, particularly when it is ""your coin"" it is hard to see.

Wall Street has decided you're not responsible enough to buy GME. This is why we need DeFi.,"For years, the crypto community has pointed to government control over fiat money as the reason Bitcoin needs to exist. People need an asset that they know can't be arbitrarily printed or controlled by corrupt governments.

And after 12 years, this narrative is taking hold. The financial industry is starting to take Bitcoin seriously, investors and large corporations are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet to reduce their dependency on the behavior of the US federal government.

**But the next fight is upon us.**

This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.

As of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in ""reduce only mode"".

Wall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.

Of course, hedge funds will still have access to GME and AMC. But not you.

**This is why Bitcoin is only the beginning of this revolution.**

It's not simply enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.

**This is why we need DeFi**

Nobody can turn off Uniswap. Nobody can turn off Aave. Nobody can turn off Synthetix.

Nobody can tell you that leverage-longing some shitcoin is irresponsible and you're not allowed to do it.

**This can be our moment.**

Thousands of people, from WSB to Twitter, have just been deplatformed, just for wanting to invest their money as they see fit.

We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

Experience in incesting matters,"Before I began investing, I read a lot about the market. Bear markets, bull markets, technical analysis and fundamental analysis were all on my reading list.

I invested my money at a point I thought was good (mistake, I should've DCA'd) and let it sit.

I now see my mistake. But more importantly, I see why I learned from it. If I had put a smaller sum down, I would have learned the exact same lesson, but still had money to put in while the market moves sideways.

My takeaway from this is that you should definitely DCA slowly if your a first year crypto investor. Trust this advice from somebody who bought at the top.

And apparently I can't post from this account yet, so here was a post on the same subject I was attempting to make for some newcomers:\n\n\\----\n\nImpressed with the support levels after the drop. Couple reminders for the newcomers:-The bigger the green run, the bigger the drop. This is consolidation and it's very helpful for long term stability. The new support forming here is considerably higher than the last.\n\n\\-Do you think the 2021 bull run is over? General predictions would assume its length would be longer than 2017, setting new ATHs across the board. We're certainly not there yet. These 20% drops shake off weak hands, and create a new strong psychological entry point for investors.\n\n\\-Have you noticed all your friends/family starting to ask about crypto and find out how to get in? If you were here by now, you're still early enough to enjoy more of this run.\n\nWith ALL that said, and with plenty of confidence from this 8 year crypto investor that this run has a lot of fuel left, these are the most important things to remember:\n\n\\-Don't invest anything you can't afford or anything you need soon. Patience wins out in crypto, and if you sell in the red or buy in the green you're making it infinitely more difficult on yourself.\n\n\\-Don't be afraid to take some profits. Have a coin that just went up 400% in the last couple months? Sell 25% of your shares. Now you're just investing house money, and when a big correction comes you'll have cash for it. I just rode ETC from $6 to $175, but sold 10% every $50 up. Now I've made back a great profit, still have my ETC, and am ready to buy more today. Occasional and incremental profits make these red days seem like a beautiful discount and another opportunity to build your ideal crypto portfolio.\n\n\\-DIVERSIFY! First off, diversify with other investments. Crypto shouldn't be more than 20% of your investment portfolio in my opinion (I said 10% in 2017 and I'll probably say 30% in a few years). But diversify within crypto. We're getting into the trenches of this bull run, and you're going to start seeing some crazy gains on random coins soon. Better to have your chips in a lot of places so you're less exposed to any one drop, but a part of all the spikes you care about. But when you diversify...\n\n\\-Don't invest in shit coins. Do your research. If you invest in good tech, you'll win long term typically. If you invest in meme coins, not only are you exposing yourself to a 99% loss, you're also hurting the long term sustainability of crypto in general. As someone who profited greatly from the last bull run, but ended up getting burned with an over-investment in Fun Fair during the crash, trust me. Even when the moon runs seem tempting, it's not worth it (that one was $.005 to $0.20 and right back down.)\n\n\\-Always keep money aside for the next bear market. If you do, you'll be thrilled at those prices long term. If you don't you'll panic. I sold 350,000 ADA at $.02 and 50 Ethereum @ $400. Had I taken out even 10% of my profits initially I would've been in a much better position to be a buyer than a seller. Learn from my mistakes - if you believe in the tech, plan for the future, but don't limit yourself for tomorrow.\n\nAnyways, just some thoughts on a red day. I remember lots of days like these were stressful for me years back, and now they're oddly comforting. But if you follow the basic principles you have a great opportunity to profit in the short term and thrive in the long term.\n\nGood luck to you all (and stop burning money in Doge)"", ""It's just the PTSD to be honest. \n\nGood intentions from vets"", 'Right?!?!

Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. **We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them.**

I want to try and clear up some of the numerous misconceptions. Please note that Lightning Network is not perfect and there are legitimate criticisms, but few people in this thread actually understand well enough to levie those criticisms.\n\n* *I can already do this with PayPal/Venmo/WeChat/Alipay*\n\nThose are all 100% centralized, permissioned systems that utilize inflationary fiat currency and can ban you and seize your funds at any time. These services may appear instant to end users, but still have to navigate legacy financial networks that require days/weeks/months to actually settle payments.\n\n* *I can already do this with my debit card / bank transfer in China/Europe/India/USA*\n\n70% of the population in El Salvador do not have bank accounts or access to any financial services. You are bragging about using a 100% centralized, permissioned system subject to heavy inflation and which can ban you and seize your funds at any time, but that\'s not what El Salvador and other Latin American countries need. The number of US Dollars in existence has increased by 1000% in the past 10 years. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL\n\n* *Haha and it only cost $20 in transaction fees!*\n\nNo, this is a Bitcoin transaction sent via Lightning Network. The transaction fee would have been about 1-2 satoshis, or around 3/100ths of one cent. Also, even without LN, Bitcoin\'s transaction fees are currently extremely low.\n\n* *Okay well have fun waiting 2 days for a confirmation lmao!*\n\nNo, this is a Bitcoin transaction sent via Lightning Network. The transaction is secure as soon as it arrives in a few seconds. There is no need to wait for a confirmation.\n\n* *Yea but Lightning Network is centralized!*\n\nNo, it\'s definitely not! There are [currently](https://1ml.com/) over 20,000 LN nodes and 50,000 payment channels available. Anyone can run their own LN node because it is a decentralized and permissionless protocol. It is also possible to use LN in a custodial fashion for small amounts.\n\n* *But only on-chain bitcoin transactions count as bitcoin transactions.*\n\nA bitcoin transaction is a bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin sent via Lightning Network utilizes multisig and smart contracts that securely and privately transmit payments without actually broadcasting them to the blockchain until counterparties decide to settle their transaction histories to the main chain. This is why LN can operate so quickly and cheaply. \n\n* *Bitcoin is crashing today so she already lost all her money!*\n\nThis video was recorded a couple weeks ago.

I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund,"Hello! 

I remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!

Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it üçç The Pineapple Fund.

Yes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)

So far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:

* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.

* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa

* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more

* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. 

If you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)

All transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)

This is incredibly generous of you. I foolishly sold my btc for what now looks like a hilariously paltry sum a few years ago. This is an incredible idea and I'm sure many people will benefit. \n\n\nI was going to suggest a donation to the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF). OMF is working to develop a cure for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a misunderstood disease that affects an estimated 17 million people and often leaves them unable to work. 25% of those people are so sick they're unable to leave their bed. \n\n\nThis time last year, I was working a full time job, recently having completed a purchase of my first property, going to the gym 3/4 times a week, and generally enjoying life. Then I caught a virus which I never recovered from. Fast forward to now, and I've been living with my parents since then, who are my primary carers. I rely on them to cook for me, help take me to doctors appointments, and help me with going up and down stairs. \n\n\nThe reason I have to rely on my parents for this, is because I suffer from an extreme feeling of illness all day. Imagine having the flu, but constantly, day after day, month after month. In addition, I get dizzy if I sit upright, feel more sick if I spend too long doing cognitively 'complicated' things like watching tv or reading. My muscles are severely weak, and I get frequent joint paint. I have to rest, with no stimulus, for hours every day, to even be able to be on speaking terms with my parents. When people visit they're surprised to see me able to talk and seem 'normal', but what they don't see is that after they leave I feel horrifically ill as a consequence. \n\n\nMy story is not unusual among those with this disease. We are, by and large, left alone by the medical profession and left to fend for ourselves, with a poor prognosis and scant hope of recovery. There is no universally suitable or effective treatment. OMF relies on charitable donations to survive, and has assembled a world-class teams of scientists to cure this horrific illness. \n\nAll the best to you, and I hope you consider them as a worthy beneficiary of your donation. \n\nEdit: added the OMF bitcoin donation page: [https://www.omf.ngo/donate-by-bitcoin/](https://www.omf.ngo/donate-by-bitcoin/)"", 'Not all heroes wear capes.

NFTs have some actual use cases, but what people are currently doing with them on altcoin platforms is not one of them.\n\nBelow I will explain how the NFTs on altcoin platforms work on a technical level and I will explain why they probably wont even exist in 10 years. I will also explain why some of these NFTs are selling for such high prices.\n\nMany of those NFTs that were sold for crazy high prices were not actually sold to other people. The person who bought those expensive NFTs is often the same person who minted the NFT in the first place. I will explain how whales can easily own very expensive rare NFTs for very little cost. They can just mint an NFT and sell it to them self for $500,000 worth of et“ª. They will only lose the small percentage that the NFT marketplace takes and now they own a super rare NFT worth $500k and they will still have most of their et“ª because they sold the NFT to them self. And there is a small chance that they might be able to to sell that worthless NFT to some fool who believes that it is actually valuable. Doing this also entices more newbies to mint NFTs in the hopes of getting rich.\n\nSome people are now using flash loans to borrow large amounts of et“ª so that they can purchase their own NFTs for extremely high prices and then they pay back the flash loan all in the same block. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122516/how-a-cunning-trick-made-it-look-like-a-cryptopunk-sold-for-532-million\n\nHere is another example that can be done. You can mint an NFT and sell it to yourself for $1000, then put it up for sale and buy it from yourself again for $1500, and sell it to yourself another time for $2200. Now you can put this appreciating NFT up for sale and try to sell it to some fool who sees it keeps getting sold for more and thinks that it must be valuable.\n\nHave you seen celebrities buying NFTs like jpegs of bored apes for hundreds of thousands of dollars? Platforms like MoonPay are paying those celebrities to claim that they bought those NFTs. Those celebrities didn\'t really pay anything for those NFTs. Those celebrities actually got paid for receiving those NFTs. You can often look at the blockchain and see that the et“ª that was used to buy the NFT came directly from a platform like MoonPay, as is the case with the bored ape NFTs that Post Malone recently ""bought for $700k+""\n\nThe current NFTs are useful for something. These NFTs are a useful tool for laundering illegally acquired cryptocurrency. Criminals can shift around their ill gotten crypto between different tokens, mint an NFT, and purchase their own NFT with their dirty crypto. Now they\'ve cleaned their dirty crypto and they also own a rare NFT that\'s supposedly worth a lot of money. I mean just look at how much it sold for!\n\nIt costs anywhere from $100-$600+ to mint an NFT on et“ªereum depending on the current gas fees and where you mint it. So they\'re [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are spending millions of dollars worth of et“ªereum minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.\n\n**All these NFT tokens being sold on et“ªereum right now either point to a URL on the internet, or an IPFS hash. In most circumstances they reference an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the same startup that sold the NFT. That URL also isn\'t the media. That URL is a JSON metadata file.** The owners of the servers have no obligation to continue storing the media. Now let\'s take a look at a couple of real NFTs and see how they work on a technical level.\n\nhttps://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1\n\nThis NFT token is for this JSON file hosted directly on Nifty\'s servers as shown below: https://api.niftygateway.com/beeple/100010001/\n\nThat file refers to the actual media that was ""bought."" Which in this case is hosted by Cloudinary CDN, which is served by Nifty\'s servers again. So if Nifty goes bust, this token is now worthless. It refers to nothing and this can\'t be changed. \n\nNow we\'ll take a look at the $69,346,250 Beeple, sold by Christies. It\'s so expensive. Surely it isn\'t centralized, right? Wrong, it\'s pointless: https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\n\nThat NFT token refers directly to an IPFS hash. We can take that IPFS hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz\n\nSo well done for referring to IPFS, it references the specific file rather than a URL that might break! **But** the metadata links to: https://ipfsgateway.makersplace.com/ipfs/QmXkxpwAHCtDXbbZHUwqtFucG1RMS6T87vi1CdvadfL7qA\n\nThis is an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com, the same NFT minting startup which will go bust one day.\n\nYou might say ""*just refer to the IPFS hash in both places!*"" But IPFS only serves files as long as a node in the IPFS network **intentionally** keeps hosting it. Which means when the startup who sold you the NFT goes bust, the files will probably vanish from IPFS too. [This is already happening.](https://twitter.com/CheckMyNFT/status/1371960028765245440) There are already [NFTs with IPFS resources that are no longer hosted anywhere.](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/1371509988179464196)\n\nAnd just pinning the file on your own IPFS node also wont work because the metadata file generally points to a specific HTTP IPFS gateway URL and not the IPFS hash. This means that when the gateway operator goes bust, I can buy the domain and start serving dick pics lol\n\nRight now NFT\'s are built on an absolute house of cards constructed by the people selling them, and it is likely that every NFT sold on et“ªereum so far will be broken within a decade. This creates a pretty solid exit plan for makersplace if they run into financial problems. The people who own the these useless NFTs ""worth"" millions of dollars are going to be pretty motivated to buy the site or fund it.

"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015","&#x200B;

**Edit.**

Thanks for all your suggestions and support.

I've received news from localbitcoins, I will update this once the authorities get in touch and decide course of action.

&#x200B;

In may 2015  [/BTC-OTC/](https://localbitcoins.com/p/BTC-OTC/)  scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days.  At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months

When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at ‚Ç¨10.000 to  ‚Ç¨15.000 for civil proceedings,

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

We @paxful work tirelessly on this and being in the worlds most challenging markets, Nigeria etc.. only makes the challenge greater (but also means our fraud defense is super tight). We ban hundreds of scammers a day and in those cases, we do hold suspend funds in escrow, but only for those who are proven to have scammed others and then these coins are later distributed to scam victims. I‚Äôm not trying to make light of your situation as you are CLEARLY LEGIT nor am I defending LBC or even Paxful, just letting you know things are rough out there in p2p land.\n\nLet me state clearly that THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON PAXFUL! We have 24/7 support and even a complicated case like this wouldn‚Äôt ever take more than a day or two, especially with the proof you have provided. At the very least we can liaise with the bank in question and inform them you were receiving payment for good and services rendered on our platform.\n\nOne of our employees has had over 1 BTC held by LBC for over three years as well and they refuse to release it even after he KYC‚Äôed and there was clearly no fraud as he was selling bitcoins. I don‚Äôt know their reasons.\n\nNot sure how I can help here but I am willing to listen to feedback. Without vendors, there is no P2P and the reason we exist is that we listen to you guys.

We are actively recruiting bitcoin sellers in #Venezuela and #Turkey now so if you can help and have bank account in either of those countries please do make an account on Paxful and put up an offer to sell people bitcoins. Even if you just REMIT money to Venezuela if you do it with bitcoin you can make 20% not lose 10% like with Western Union, just put up an offer to sell for a certain amount for bank transfer and give the buyer of your bitcoin the bank account of the person you are sending money too! it works like Magic and they get 20% more and you only pay less than a 1% fee to Paxful for the escrow!

Whenever LBC is recommended it tends to be a last resort. There are now better options and if you are concerned with privacy then that can be dealt with other ways.

Appreciate the guys in Iran, Venezuela etc don‚Äôt have other options but if you do I recommend taking them. The ecosystem is evolving. \n\nWith what you said, as far as LBC goes, i‚Äôm now out.

This is a coin I am genuinely passionate about and have been in from near enough day one ‚Äì the telegram community that has developed around it has to be one of the most tight knit I have experienced, and it is exciting that we are adding new members every day.¬† It has certainly been a rollercoaster journey so far and I am not promising a smooth journey, but I personally believe any investor getting in now will be very pleased long term. ¬† 

¬† 

To summarise, I feel this coin, with such a low market cap and with the ambition the developers have shown, is primed to moon üåï

¬† 

The most exciting thing is that we found out yesterday that the coin was approved for¬†Coin Market Cap listing¬†üìàüìà(searchable and can be added to watch list). This has been a huge goal for the developers and anyone getting in before the listing goes live (once we hit the required daily volume and marketcap) we will be there for everyone to see. We also saw the price go x10 when we went live on Coin Gecko a few weeks ago and Coin Market Cap is much larger. 

¬† 

We have also begun to see some real exposure with various youtubers covering us with many having over 100,000 subscribers. Here is one review:

A coin I have been in since the stealth launch which was ruined by whale & bot buyers and bad actors manufacturing a crash. We became a small community of core holders and have helped grow the coin since through spreading the word and holding strong with others seemed to not believe. The devs have worked tirelessly to deliver for the community and I firmly believe this has an extremely bright future and I can‚Äôt believe how early it is still. 

¬† 

There was naturally some initial FUD spread by bad actors around the coin but the team have vastly addressed these issues and gone out of their way to appease the community with decreasing the tax and locking the code whilst also delivering some huge announcements.

S W - deflationary - $290k mcap - 2100 holders - unique tokenomics,"

Tired of always been late to a coin?

Tired of rug pulls?

Tired of seeing others x10 and x100 on their crypto whilst yours do nothing?
¬†
Price is going a bit mad right now due to a new video dropped so hard to pin down price and market cap (and holders for that matter)
¬†
Let me introduce you to  S W -  make your moneys worth, be smart.
¬†
+ 2150 holders
+ $260k market cap
+ 892 Total supply
+ 108b burned
+ Launched 26th¬†April 2021
+ Deflationary
+ 1% burn rate
+ 1% reflection rate
+ 2% tax rate (lowered form 8% by devs after listening to the community)
+ LP locked until 2024
+ Coin Gecko listed
+ 2k active telegram group
¬†
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coin itself has reached some amazing milestones already such as:

+ Achieving a coin gecko listing 2 days after application.

+ Being featured on a Turkish crypto channel with 120k subscribers

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO6u7xYSULlrxfAWgjBOQJQ

+ Being featured on an English crypto channel with 100k + subscribers ¬†
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8wXpVINhSENNMCiXYMAROg

+ Ran a trial banner ad campaign on coin gecko
¬†
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many things to look forward to over the next week ALONE:
+ Imminent decision on Coin Market Cap listing application
+ A big marketing campaign starting on 14th¬†May funded by the tax rate
+ White paper being released
+ Website revamp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found this coin randomly on a reddit post and have become fully involved in the telegram community and have never quite experienced such a tight knit group after such a short period. It was definitely a bumpy start with whales and bots buying up a lot of the coin after a soft launch and there being a dump by them from an all-time high market cap of $2.5 million. The community rebuilt from a lowly market cap of $7k as nothing had really changed but a few bad actors spreading FUD and the community has gone from strength to strength with the developers consistently surprising us by listening to our ideas and suggestions. I have been constantly adding to my amount after buying in a small amount when the token first took off and I personally see a big future. I am really excited about what the future holds for S W and it is evident from the people in the community that they really want it to grow and prosper. It still feels so early and at times feels like the best kept secret in crypto for me with only a market cap of $230k and holders at 2100. I regularly see meme coins with no utility or serious intentions hit market caps in the millions. It definitely has taken patience with this coin and mental steel holding through jumps to $600k + twice from coin gecko listing and other catalysts but what was promising to see was almost all the top wallets haven‚Äôt sold ¬†throughout and are if anything adding.
¬†
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long term there are plans such as:
¬†
+ Community decided purchases
+ Building own exchange
+ Social platform

I want to share 1 tip so you can see the dip coming.,"First off, I should preface this with a little bit about me. Been around btc since 2012 and holding since.  I dabble in alts that I believe in. Good team / clear white paper and a solid value prop. I will never pump a coin just to pump, but I will dump a coin/token if I lose faith in the alt team or I don't like what's coming out of their camp. I'm pretty good at seeing through people.  If I bring up a coin it will come with sound reasoning. Moving on... getting to my tip.  

I believe everyone knows that BTC whales control the altcoin market. They have so much buying-power it‚Äôs insane. Many belong and participate in ‚Äòwhale rings‚Äô and these rings purchase specific coins together and because they are using what is essentially all profit from mining or purchasing early BTC they can buy massive amounts of altcoins, pump the volume and price up substantially. This is one reason why things are volatile and will always be. Crypto wealth is extremely disproportional.  Dips happen often because if you buy a lot of coins for little money, you can make massive gains on a slight uptick and shortly after the whales are dumping. It's all strategic. Speculators tend to attribute dips to nonsense. From country or bank banning crypto or whatever. This type of BS is not the reason things go red. The reality is that whales influence the direction of the market. Call it what you want. This is how I see it. 

A lot of people ask me about timing/dips. Obviously, I don‚Äôt have all the answers but I‚Äôm pretty good at spotting where things are heading over a 24-72 hour period. It's not rocket science. Pattern recognition is pretty easy if you understand the order books and depth charts. But a really good indicator of a market shift or whale ring movement is putting USDT on your favorite list and watch it. When a dip is coming and things are going from green to red, give USDT a look (on the exchange you trade on not just CMC) and if it‚Äôs 1:02-1.03+ this means whales are using USDT as a bridge before they crash the market for the little guys. If you spot 1.03 you can be sure the whales are dumping the altcoin and putting their short-term gains and profits into USDT until the cycle starts again. If you review the USDT historical charts you will see high volume at these price points. USDT is a good utility to maintain gains if used properly. Generally speaking, whales tend not to go from altcoin to bitcoin when they know everything is about to dip because again, they control the market. Whales often swim together (pod, gam, school etc whatever you want to call it) and they pull out ( go their own way) at different times typically 12-24 hour periods because this is global and people sleep while others are up. 

USDT is a misunderstood coin. It‚Äôs a tool, a bridge, a vehicle... Not an ""investment."" Put it on your tracker and keep your eye on it when refreshing your alt portfolio. 

Hope this helps. If it doesn‚Äôt - don‚Äôt use my tip. 

Edit: so my intention was to post this just before the dip started but the original post got deleted by the auto mod. It was manually published after I discussed the issue with the human mod. If you view this pic you will see a before and after of the dip. I think this makes my point... sorta.  https://m.imgur.com/a/KNVpI",itchy-balls,altcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/7s3wet/i_want_to_share_1_tip_so_you_can_see_the_dip/,1516602075.0,144,408,20,"[""I noticed this same pattern and developed a script to monitor this phenomenon after seeing it over Christmas. \n\nHere's a link (no ads or bs):\n[Altcoin volatility index](http://altmoo.com/crypto-analysis/altcoin-volatility-index.php)\n\nThe system continuously watches volumes and fluctuations in USDT from CMC.

XRP is arguably one of the most talked about coins. It had a noticeable slump between 13th Jan and 17th Jan.\n\nOn the 13th XRP was around $2 \n\nAt the time, Tether was showing $1.01 or $1.00\n\nOver the next 3 days (preceding the dip), you can see the following:\n\n- Tether peeked to $1.03 on the 14th\n- it dropped to $1.01 on the 15th\n- it rose sharply to $1.03 on the 16th\n- peeked at $1.04 in the early hours of the 17th before dropping back down to $1.01 in the mid afternoon.\n\nOn the 17th, the value of XRP dipped to $0.91 so for me, this is good proof that the OPs tip is legit. You might have to watch fora small series of spikes, but I like it none the less.\n\nQuick question from me.... Would this not be good times as an indicator to buy the altcoins instead of looking to dump them? It's handy to be able to watch for the spikes and then hope for a sharp drop. This would be especially good for HODLrs. "", 'If tether goes up, doesn‚Äôt that mean they have already pulled their money out of altcoins?

Altcoin glossary: A crypto jargon guide 101,"Because I see a lot of new altcoin enthusiasts joining /r/altcoin, I made a simple glossary with crypto jargon. Do you miss anything? Don't hesitate to add it as a comment (I will edit the post).

---

**Altcoin**, the abbreviation for alternative coin, or alternate coin, or all blockchain projects and related currency that exist in addition to Bitcoin.

**Bearish**, a downward trend.

**Block** is a part of the Blockchain and is usually associated with an encrypted hash with the previous block in the block.

**Blockchain**, very neatly explained by [Nieuwsuur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARwzaQV7AwU) (or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9KAnkZUjU)), but in text: a decentralized database that maintains a data list that can not be manipulated.

**BTC (‡∏ø)**. I do not intend to spell out all currencies, but Bitcoin is an exception.

**Bullish**, an upward trend.

**Core wallet**, a wallet that contains the whole blockchain and most of the time delivers tools to give developers the ability to program in or on the blockchain.

**Circulation supply**, number of coins that are actually circulating.

**Dapps** *aka* applications written in the blockchain, which means it's a *d*ecentralized *app*lication *aka* Dapp.

**Electrum wallet**, a light weight wallet to store coins. Doesn‚Äôt download the blockchain, but gets the information from a third party.

**Encryption**, data lock that can only be unlocked with a private key.

**Exchange**, sometimes called coinexchange, is the exchange office where buyers and sellers can trade in Bit and Altcoins. Examples are Litebit, BTCdirect, Kraken and Bittrex.

**Fiat** money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation or law. Think of $, ¬£, ¬• or ‚Ç¨.

**FOMO** means Fear Of Missing Out. As the term suggests, the Bitcoin or an altcoin rises sharply in value and investors take steps without rationale ‚Äì so emotion ‚Äì because they are afraid to miss the boat.

**FUD** stands for Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt. In the world of crypto FUD means spreading fear, uncertainty or doubt about a certain blockchain project.

**Hash**, an encryption that can no longer be undone.

**[HODL](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)**, either hold, but then written wrong. Reportedly a Bitcointalk user wearing a drunk mood over his keyboard. HODL is currently jargon for long-term investor cryptocurrency trader. Nice acronym mentioned in the comments: Hold On Despite Loss.

**[ICO](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/06/whats-an-ico-and-how-to-participate/)**, Initial Coin Offering. A crowd sale that offers the opportunity to purchase digital coins from a new blockchain project.

**Market cap**: price per coin *x* circulating supply.

**Max Supply**, maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in currency lifetime.

**Miner**, device validating the blockchain (transactions).

**Mining reward**, the reward that a miner receives for the computing power he delivers to check the nodes in the blockchain.

**Mnemonic Phrase** a fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.

**Public key**, publicly accessible ‚Äúkey‚Äù, in crypto currency jargon your wallet.

**Private key**, the key to open your wallet.

**Proof of Stake**, verification of the blockchain is done by (wallet) adresses with a certain amount of coins. The more coins means the more authority and computing power for verifying the blockchain.

**[Proof of Work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work)** is roughly a method where blockchain(transactions) are verified with computing power. 

**Satoshi** is the smallest part of a bitcoin. 1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 ‡∏ø.

**[Smart contract](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/10/what-is-a-smart-contract/)** See a smart contract as a set of rules that can no longer be modified because it is stored in the blockchain. A smart contract will be executed if the circumstances comply to the set of rules.

**[Wallet](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/04/which-wallet-should-i-choose/)**, a digital wallet on cryptocurrency. Examples are [Jaxx](http://www.jaxx.io), [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/) and the [Gulden Wallet](https://gulden.com/).

Astrobotic Technology is\r\nan American privately held company that is developing space robotics technology for lunar\r\nand planetary missions. It was founded in 2007 by Carnegie Mellon professor Red Whittaker\r\nand his associates, with the goal of winning the Google Lunar X Prize. More than a decade\r\nlater Astrobotic became the largest NASA contractor with government funding of more than\r\n$200M.\r\n- Our main goal with this partnership is to promote cryptocurrencies worldwide, once again\r\npushing boundaries in terms of crazy marketing ideas. We strongly believe this is the\r\nmost effective way to popularize this technology and we want to be a leader of this\r\nchange.\r\n- We are about to send a certain amount of $SUPERBID tokens to the moon surface on a\r\ndevice, which is a hardware wallet for storing all types of cryptocurrencies. On top of\r\nthat, we want to connect the campaign with our current and future base of influencers, to\r\ncreate a viral movement. The details will be disclosed in the coming weeks, as we see\r\nthis partnership as a long-term activation.\r\n- Astrobotic will not only help Superbid send tokens to the Moon surface, but also be the\r\nfirst official corporate partner, who will hold auctions on our platform. Do you want to feel\r\nlike a space engineer for one day? Here you go‚Ä¶\r\nOverall, this partnership is beneficial for SuperBid for 3 main reasons:\r\n- 1. It helps propel our mission of taking cryptocurrencies into the mainstream even\r\nfurther. By partnering with a government contractor, we are getting closer to affecting\r\npositive, crypto related change on a global level. There is plenty of attention already\r\naround cryptocurrencies going to the moon, and we are actually the ones doing it for\r\nreal.\r\n- 2. Holders of the $SUPERBID token are in for a unique opportunity in the future, where\r\nthey will be able to engage with Astrobotic and our mission to the moon. The details of this will be released soon, and it will be an incredible event to be a part of. We will have\r\na system to check how many tokens are in your wallet, and you will be able to participate\r\nin tiers of this activity based on your balance.\r\n- 3. As a long term partner with Astrobotic, we will not only be taking cryptocurrencies into the mainstream but also they will be utilizing our app for running their own auctions as our first corporate auction partner. Do you want to live a day in the life of a rocket engineer, or even watch a rocket launch yourself? The possibilities are astronomical with\r\nSuperBid and Astrobotic.', 'mates, what do you feel, will the $GenX token pump this year?

Beyond Protocol eliminates hacks and facilitates machine-to-machine value transfer. \n\nWith security as a given, Beyond Protocol allows us to feel comfortable opening up our devices for collaboration. Using them like threads of yarn, the dreamers among us can weave together inventions we would have not thought to conceive. \n\nFrom the smart phone -- a camera, a touch screen, GPS, an internet connection -- applications were built which revolutionized entire industries (e.g. Uber and Instagram). From Beyond Protocol, mega applications can be engineered on top of any combination of IoT devices: from smart pills to satellites. Imagine a Nest smoke alarm paying a drone to put out a fire, and the drone making micropayments to weather towers along the way to determine the best route. Beyond Protocol sets out to be the ethical language of machines.\n\nAfter over a year of R&D, in early 2019, the Beyond Protocol team put forth the first iterations of its novel technology to a handful of partners. The technology allows its partners, with one line of code, to i. enable secure message brokering between devices through hardware signatures ii. equip devices with a cryptocurrency-based payment gateway. At present, there are no out-of-box solutions for either capability. \n\nBeyond seeks to build real, practical solutions for device security and payments from consumers to devices, and soon, among an economy of devices. Beyond envisions a future where good triumphs over evil and technology can work to create an exponentially more safe and more beautiful world.\n\nProject Resources\n\nOverview: [https://docsend.com/view/upvdx52](https://docsend.com/view/upvdx52)\n\nBeyond Protocol (video): [https://vimeo.com/258860331](https://vimeo.com/258860331)\n\nToken metrics: [https://docsend.com/view/32kgadc](https://docsend.com/view/32kgadc)\n\nTechnical Resources\n\nWhitepaper: [https://docsend.com/view/si72wby](https://docsend.com/view/si72wby)\n\nTechnical Overview: [https://docsend.com/view/bujtxem](https://docsend.com/view/bujtxem)\n\nTechnical Roadmap (2021 Q2 update): [https://docsend.com/view/xu3zgbf6gtbvyfse](https://docsend.com/view/xu3zgbf6gtbvyfse)\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: Do you plan to ICO/IEO?\n\nA: To fund our project, and to seed our cryptocurrency, Beyond will sell its tokens from time to time ahead of a public listing.

"""Cheap"" coins are not as cheap as they seem","We've just added feature to our comparison tool. You can compare coins by their levels of supply (either total or circulating). We normalise the price of the coin by removing unit bias. This feature gives you a good view of the coins that look ""cheap"" but are probably not as cheap as they seem.

E.g: We assume that XRP had the same circulating supply as BTC, and use the formula (XRP Supply / BTC supply * XRP Price) to remove unit bias. Under these conditions, XRP price would be $ 2,913. Matching by total supply, XRP price = $ 6,023

Cabread is offering a fully functional arcade with an NFT reward system.,"Catbread is a self staking deflationary token and the primary currency for the retro arcade of the same name that's just been launched. You buy tickets to play the games within the arcade at $.25 a ticket in Catbread. A scoreboard is shown below each game and the top 3 scores are awarded NFT prizes weekly. A more efficient award system will be implemented in the future to award frequent players as well. 

The current plan is to release a game every two weeks. Awards will be changed bi-monthly with a focus on hiring NFT artists from the community to complete Catbread exclusive NFTs. There's also an NFT viewer in development as well as a market place planned. 

AMA's are held on the official youtube channel once to twice a week to touch base with holders interested. The team is incredibly transparent with the wallet for the arcade fully disclosed. 

Highlights -

A simple retro game will be launched every two weeks while the the original game is developed. The platform will be opened soon for indie devs. 

Social media type structure planned. I.E feeds and trophy room for highscore NFTs. Audit soon. Asian market is being tapped now with a month long campaign App planned. Custom NFT viewer coming soon. Lead is doxxed and has AMA's weekly via youtube live. 

The beta is a FULLY functional arcade with a payment system. The only issues now are with iOS integration, but this is nearly fixed. There's only one game for now since the focus was on backend security and integration. 

An original IP with a story is in development currently using roguelike games, Ninja Gaidan and dungeon crawlers as inspiration. 

Project seeks to be a retro NFT/Crypto combination of Steam & Newgrounds. This means eventually becoming a publisher. 

WeChat campaign goes live as soon as they're finished with maintenance on verification services. Weibo campaign is live now. 

Publications are being turned out with articles already on Yahoo Finance and Business Insider. 

Short term roadmap is as follows -Catman
 -Asian marketing push -Mainpage overhaul and migration to arcade page servers - Galacat AUG 8th 
-full professional audit 
-Breadout 
-Catris 
-NFT viewer 
-Original IP -Mobile APP 

Base coin tokenomics: Each transaction has a 10% tax. Five percent of that tax is redistributed to holders. Five percent is sent to the liquidity 
pool. A very small percentage of both is sent to the burn wallet. These tokenomics were chosen because 10% seemed like a number that wasn't too impactful in regards to transactions yet large enough to add up significantly with added volume for redistribution and token growth via the liquidity pool. We also added a 1% supply cap for each wallet. This ensures that one person wouldn't control enough of a supply to negatively impact the price further down the road while still allowing a significant return. 

Arcade tokenomics: A transparent and trackable wallet collects funds that are deposited from ticket purchases. The beta's funds will go directly into liquidity at first to decrease volitility. The primary use of funds from the arcade will then shift into paying for artists, community events, development and marketing. 

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 Total Burned: 423t 44.3% Amount in circulation: 576.5t+ Ownership is renounced. 2% has been allocated to raising market capital. 

The 3 original team members have disclosed they have a single max 1% wallet for personal profit each. 

APY has been swinging between 30% and 400%

üï∫üåéAgain, on marketing campaigns, FEED will start a campaign with famous celebrities worldwide to spread the project around the world.

üìäüìéA new digital marketing and positioning agency has been hired to obtain an organic and real growth of its social networks.

üì°üî®Website will take a new shape soon. The team is trying to develop something eye-catching and more user friendly.

‚è©üîÄSeveral solutions to make it easier to invest in FEED for people who are not used to investing in cryptocurrencies have been looked at. (working on it, people will be able to buy FEED with FIAT directly without all the intermediate steps).

Lastly, Feed is determined to team up with prestigious associations fighting against hunger.

üü£üí∏These marketing plans only prove that Feed is a long-term project and they want to build a solid ecosystem while building its foundation. Whatsapp, YouTube, Tiktok, and other social media marketing campaigns are currently ongoing. The token is currently at a solid entry point ($0.0175 = $1.7million MC) That said, I see another bullish run. Let's make the most out of FEED‚Äôs good store of value.

Why Sell?,"Why would anyone sell? Bitcoin now costs the same as it did the day after Thanksgiving. Ethereum costs the same as it did on Jan 2. Neo is currently twice as much as it was Dec 21. Monero is at 233 and it never broke 200 until this past December. Cardano is now right where it was in mid December. It's too bad people are glued to their hourly account balance and missing out on the big picture. Emotionally distraught people are selling. Financially wise people are buying. This summer, there is going to be alot of bitter folks that wish they never logged into their accounts on Feb 1 2018. Countries around the world are not banning crypto. They are simply cleaning things up and gearing up for full blown legal crypto. Sure, there will be new rules but crypto is here to stay. If tomorrow marked the final day of cryptocurrency history, I could understand the panic and the selling. However, do you think the Canadian gov't would be using Ethereum for record keeping if crypto was in trouble? Would IBM be partnering with Stellar if crypto was doomed? Would Microsoft be sponsoring NEO dev competitions if crypto was ending? Would Samsung be pouring big money into building and selling cryptocurrency mining chips if Crypto was truly in trouble? Politicians are pumping the breaks until they figure out how to cash in. They did they same thing with daily fantasy sports, online poker, gambling, and cannabis. In 2015, Daily Fantasy Sports was legal in 45 states. In 2016, it was legal in only 10 states because politicians wanted to shut it down until they figured out how to make money off it for themselves. Today, DFS is legal in 41 states. That's right, from an unregulated 45 (2015), cracked down to 10 (2016), and now that politicians can make money off the regulated industry, it's legal in 41. Folks, crypto is going through the growing pains of becoming a full blown accepted industry. Check out online poker...

- 1995: The first online poker websites appear. Everyone made money except governments.

- 1999: Republican from Virginia, Robert Goodlatte, tried to shut it down with a new law. People panicked and cashed out. His law never passed. It was defeated.

- 2003: Thanks to pressure from the Justice Department, most banks blocked customers from sending money to poker sites

- 2005: The world's largest online poker site (PartyGaming) went live on the London Stock exchange the same year that a Republican from Iowa tried to ban credit card payments on gambling sites. His bill never reached the Senate floor.

- 2006: Goodlatte is back again. Tries to ban online poker/gambling. He is defeated again.

- 2006: President Bush signs the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, banning the transfer of money to gambling sites. Everyone cashes out.

- Today: New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware have legalized it. People in every state freely use offshore sites. Banks are no longer blocking payments.

Whether it's online poker, cannabis, daily fantasy sports, or cryptocurrency, the people vote with their wallets. Sure, governments always get involved so they can make a buck too (if it was about our safety, health, and well being then guns would be outlawed). Hold your coins if you haven't sold. Buy coins this weekend at a massive discount. Embrace the future. Expect dips along the way. We are riding a climate change graph that continually trends up. So what if there is a record cold winter here or there. The zig-zagging line is trending up from year to year. Hold and/or buy. You will have major profits should you choose to sell this summer, fall, or in 2019.

While I think these coins will one day rise again, I do have to say that a *wise* thing to do when investing in any kind of stock or in this case, cryptocurrency, cash out what you invested. Give yourself a break-even point. it takes a lot of stress off your shoulders and the day to day ups and downs won\'t bother you as much.\n\nFurthermore, whenever there is a big spike and bump in the market, don\'t be afraid to reward yourself a little and sell some off. Spikes never sustain forever. Right now the US stock indexes are up almost 50% in the last year, from the so-called ""Trump bump,"" coupled with market and business optimism due to tax reform and so on. While this is awesome, it would be naive to think there won\'t at some point be a ""correction."" Chances are the correction brings us back down and stabilizes at a much higher level than it was a year ago, but there will be. Yes, you could hold out and hope for that extra 10-20% bump, but again, there\'s no way to know, cash out a little and reward your investment. Hell, if you really want to, put that cash you use to cash out with in a lockbox savings you won\'t touch until the day there is a crash, then you can use it to buy back in. Don\'t pull all out. That\'s not wise, but treat yourself, reward yourself.\n\nWe don\'t know how far this will drop this time, so maybe you missed that peak you want to sell at, and I definitely wouldn\'t recommend selling if you are one of those crazy people that put in their life\'s savings at 18k... you better just have a 5+ year plan to hold at this point and hope for the best lol.', ""If you expect it to go down further before it turns around, it's a great idea to sell.

Not only that, it's swung up and down by greater than 10% 3 times today, so you could have as much as 33% more ETH now.

Raiblocks (XRB),"RaiBlocks (XRB) won the Binance listing with 12945 votes. An official announcement with the exact trading date will be released soon from Binance.

For those of you that don't know, $XRB is a very exciting cryptocurrency which has been gaining a lot of attention for its zero fees, infinite transactions, and infinite scalability.

What makes RaiBlocks unique is its ""block-lattice"" structure. This basically means that each account has its own blockchain, and each block contains only a single transaction.

"If you are still using Coinbase, read this.","Today when Solana went down about 7%, I tried to withdraw my SOL from Coinbase to Solflare. I did this because CB charges outrageous fees for buying and selling and I would much rather use Solflare and Jupiter (Jup.ag) so that I can actually make a profit sometimes. Coinbase did not send my crypto, my SOL or my USDC, then they claimed I had to confirm my identity to remove my crypto. I confirmed my ID several times for each transaction, they denied it when it was obviously me and they had just accepted an ID check 3 days prior. 

I went to support about it and they literally would not release my crypto to me until SOL went back up and I no longer had the chance to buy it at a good enough price without their exorbitant fee. They said that they couldn't send it because the ""network was too clogged and I would get the money when it unclogged.""

I now realize that until my crypto leaves CB... it's not mine. I suspect what happened is that CB actually meant that they did not have enough money to give me back my crypto until the market went back up. 

Lesson learned, if you are still using CB, do yourself a favor and get your crypto out as soon as you can, because I suspect CB is having more money troubles than they are letting on. Not my keys, not my crypto.

"If you are still using Coinbase, read this.","Today when Solana went down about 7%, I tried to withdraw my SOL from Coinbase to Solflare. I did this because CB charges outrageous fees for buying and selling and I would much rather use Solflare and Jupiter (Jup.ag) so that I can actually make a profit sometimes. Coinbase did not send my crypto, my SOL or my USDC, then they claimed I had to confirm my identity to remove my crypto. I confirmed my ID several times for each transaction, they denied it when it was obviously me and they had just accepted an ID check 3 days prior. 

I went to support about it and they literally would not release my crypto to me until SOL went back up and I no longer had the chance to buy it at a good enough price without their exorbitant fee. They said that they couldn't send it because the ""network was too clogged and I would get the money when it unclogged.""

I now realize that until my crypto leaves CB... it's not mine. I suspect what happened is that CB actually meant that they did not have enough money to give me back my crypto until the market went back up. 

Lesson learned, if you are still using CB, do yourself a favor and get your crypto out as soon as you can, because I suspect CB is having more money troubles than they are letting on. Not my keys, not my crypto.

WIN: The reference for lottery tokens in the crypto sphere. A coin that already has a use-case! [0$ Market Cap],"**The project:**¬†

WIN ($TICKETS) aspires to become the most commonly known and recognized lottery token in the crypto sphere. In order for a cryptocurrency to grow and gain traction, especially in the Altcoin market, it must have a ‚Äòuse-case‚Äô, which only usually comes with the promise of a better future. Our team is motivated by the idea our coin will have a use-case from day one! The gambling industry has been around for centuries, and there will be an ever-growing crowd of ‚Äògamblers‚Äô and players in the crypto world, as cryptocurrencies slowly become the staple in terms of money transactions around the world. In order to support this transition, WIN wishes to establish itself as the most competitive and well-known lottery token in the industry, all the while progressively growing a following.¬†

**How it works:**

With WIN, the chances of winning are relative to how many tokens you hold, which means that all holders are incentivized to buy more tokens in the long term if they wish to increase their chances of winning the lottery.¬†

In addition, the requirement to be eligible at winning the lottery is relatively low, at the value of 777,777 tokens, which means all holders are incentivized to HODL in the hopes of winning a huge prize.¬†

Chances of winning will be calculated in indirect proportion to how many tokens each holder has. This means that having more tokens does increase your chances of winning, but not in a linear fashion. Instead, a logarithmic function will be used to convert the proportion of holdings that each investor has, and calculate their chances of winning accordingly.¬†

This will lower the discrepancy in the probability of winning between a whale and a small investor while keeping our larger investors at an advantage.¬†

**A note on marketing:**

In the framework of the gambling industry, marketing plays a key driver for all the parties involved. For the organization, marketing attracts a larger pool of players who can participate in the activities/lotteries. For the players, as more players are participating in the lotteries, this results in larger payouts being handed out. Since gambling is a high-risk, high reward activity, it is vital that a sufficient number of individuals are made aware of the present games in order to diversify the risks amongst the population of players.

In the case of WIN, the same applies, but with greater flexibility. Our ability to attract crypto investors as well as ‚Äògamblers‚Äô increases the impact of our marketing, but this is unfortunately counterbalanced by the fact that we need to spend on marketing on a daily basis, for the aforementioned reasons. In order for our venture to be successful in the long term, WIN needs a constant marketing push, which imposes a marketing expense as part of the prize wallet. The complete breakdown of how this is executed is given in the whitepaper on the WIN website.¬†

**Launch**

This coin is launching on Sunday, after hosting a private sale on Friday and a pre-sale on Saturday. With the current level of effort and transparency put into this project, this could be the next very big thing.¬†

Cryptoz üöÄ ($CRT) l launchpad platform for Microcap Projects l Be part of community l 100x potential | presale 16th June 2pm UTC,"I came across this project and looks very promising. Main feature is launchpad platform for small project.

It‚Äôs basically a Deflationary Token on BSC with ultra-fast yield generation, $CRT protocol is a community driven token and Launchpad Provider.

$CRT apples 7% TAX on all transaction. and the fees are proportionally split and instantly distributed as rewards among all token holders.

‚úîÔ∏è Anti whale functionality 

‚úîÔ∏è Holders will be whitelist on first IDO 

‚úîÔ∏è Strong Road map 

‚úîÔ∏è Huge marketing plans 

&#x200B;

Why is Cryptoz launchpad? Meme/Microcap Launchpad necessary?

Currently, there is a void in the market for launchpads supporting smaller projects. Micro-cap projects include meme coins, small raises/launches and charity coins. If these projects were to approach a traditional launchpad, they would most likely be rejected due to small size and lack of allocation for the launchpads themselves. Cryptoz allows these projects to raise their liquidity for LP in a fast turnaround time, while enjoying all the benefits of a traditional launchpad.

&#x200B;

üéØ Total supply: 1 trillion (deflationary)

üéØ No Team Fund. Only 4% tokens of the total supply will be kept aside for marketing initiatives.

What is Sphynx Network ?

\- Sphynx Network is using alchemy in blockchain technology so that staking  one NFT, one time only, will bring multiple rewards from different platforms simultaneously! ‚öóÔ∏è‚öóÔ∏è‚öóÔ∏è

\-> Sphynx Network is a decentralized token built on BSC network, using BEP20 standard and Solidity, audited and secured by professionals.  #BSC

\-> Sphynx Network aims to deliver a working product as a PVP and PVE combat platform, where NFTs are minted with different elementals (psychic, light, sound, air, fire, water, earth  and attributes (rarity, age, natural ability, active score, armor and weapon score, fame score, magical item score, agility charisma stamina, intellect, strength, etc) where users will fight for $SPH and BNB

&#x200B;

What makes SPH different ?

&#x200B;

\-> NFTs Will make Staking More Dynamic and Flexible by Implementing the Transferable Function That Unties the LP Stake From the User's Account. Staking Will be Linked to a Transferable NFT! 

\-> When staking with Sphynx Network, you will no longer need to unstake your assets if you want to stop staking, you can simply delegate a percentage of your stake from the NFT to an exchange and place a sell order!

\-> Sphynx Network will create a secondary market for the already staked tokens and when you are done staking, you can just go in the market and sell your NFT, since all the details will be stored in there, instead of unstaking and sell after.

Its name is ERON PROJECT. It is currently developing its own blockchain and applications and it has just launched the presale of its token - ERON.

You can see the company behind the project, as well as the team, on their website.

What you should know about ERON PROJECT for a good DYOR:

\- they currently have 2 nodes up

\- their project will develop 3 applications to start with:  ERON WALLET (the wallet of the project with decent fees), ERON PAY (the payment processor for FIAT) and ERON MARKET (fully decentralized marketplace).

\- they have finished the mining application that will provide liquidity for ERON MARKET and it will be released next week. All the people who mine ERONs will be able to use the tokens to buy products in ERON MARKET.

\-they will post their first Proof of work on the apps next weeK.

\-they also have a charity component: they want to provide basic human living standards such as filtered water, electricity and gas to people in poor areas. So, they have created an ecosystem in which the charity wallet will be able to sustain donations in the for of products to utility providers in order to extend or create utility networks in such areas.

Even if you don't buy in the pre sale, you should definitely keep an eye on the project and join their TG for info and updates.

Tokenomics of ERON TOKEN:

Total Supply: 1.000.000.000.000 ERONs¬†

The wallets are divided as follows:¬†

Grab a Kleenex and clench your fist in anger as you watch a hero of crypto get treated like crap üò°üò†

[Bitcoin 2021: Ross Ulbricht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=369s)

Are you inspired to do something after watching that? We sure as hell are.

Bitcoin early adopters Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht helped spread the use of Bitcoin when it was less than $10 dollars and someone in this community finally made a coin to help both of them get out of jail and for its holders to make some money. We call that a win-win where I‚Äôm from.

üò≤ Who the heck is Julian Assange?! ü§¶

Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, an international non-profit organization that publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. 

ü§Ø How about Ross Ulbricht?! ü§¶

Ross Ulbricht created the first darknet market, the Silk Road, as an exercise in free market capitalism, a website where users were free to post and buy whatever they felt necessary so long as no party was being harmed. 

These pioneers who have fought for individual freedom, now need our help to be saved from unjust prosecution and sentencing (far reaching government oversight amirite?). 

Join our fight and help raise funds for the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Protect your rights and generate yield at the same time!

üéá Ad Campaign! üéá

This project launched with NO ICO and is just getting started! We are starting our marketing push in December so get in EARLY!! 

üí∏Shillers will be rewarded too!üí∞

What are the Tokenomics?

‚úÖ Utility! The ‚ÄúFree‚Äù in Freemoon!

5% of every transaction is donated to the legal defenses of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht. Fight For Freedom! BE A HERO!

üí≤ Autonomous Yield AKA Money for Nothing!üí≤

3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to existing token holders via reflection.

‚¨áÔ∏è Deflationary SupplyüÜôüí∞

2% of every transaction is put back into the liquidity pool and LP tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply.

üíçüôå HODL!üíéüôå

Transaction Fee 10%

üîê Liquidity Lock üîê 

For further price stability, Freemoon will use DxLock to restrict 50% of the supply for a duration of 4 years.

Due to the sensitive nature of our cause, the team will keep things private for now. (Sadly, freedom for the good guys is a touchy subject for some lawmakers).

üßê The Rare Antiquities Token | Presale 31st August 9PM EST | NYC Times Square Billboard | Audited üßê," üßê Welcome to The Rare Antiquities Token üßê

üíØ PRESALE on UniCrypt 1st September 01:00 GMT

ü§ù Utility 1: The first Token to be used in the museum, galleries and heritage sector making entry for RAT holders FREE

The Louvre in Paris receives 10 MILLION visitors per a year! Even some of the smallest museums in the UK receive up to 80,000 visitors a year. Across Europe alone there are 100s of MILLIONS of people that visit museums on an annual basis.

Being a holder of RAT gives access to partner museums, galleries and the heritage sector FREE of charge through the RAT to Pay chargeback programme.

There is potential for 100s of 1,000s of holders if just a fraction of a % of this market use RAT to access the sector.

‚ù§Ô∏è Vitalik Buterin was recently quoted in an a talk to the Ethereum crowd in Paris as saying...

""One idea was ‚Äúretroactive funding,‚Äù in which developers effectively build public infrastructure for free and then are paid for it when it yields dividends. He explained that such a process would allow Ethereum projects to flourish as a ‚Äúpublic good.‚Äù ""

The Rare Antiquities Token aims to build that free infrastructure to bring crypto to the mainstream through the museum, gallery and heritage sector.

üìñ Utility 2: An asset backed stablecoin pegged to the ownership of appreciating antiquities - the 2% Antiquities Wallet is use for the purchase of appreciating antiquities under the ownership of the Rare Antiquities Token. The ownership of these assets adds to the market cap providing a stable baseline for the price.

ü§ì Utility 3: Through creating partnerships within the sector RAT will be used for all transactions relating to the dealing of antiquities - Through new partnerships it will be agreed that payments for the purchase of antiquities will be vested to prevent any decrease in price. RAT will become the choice currency used for all transactions across the globe for physical assets related to the museum, gallery and heritage sector.

üìà Institutional investors targeted

üé® NFTs to holders of purchased antiquities proportional to holdings

THE FRANCHISE:

Ecchicoin is probably the first crypto ‚Äúkickstarter‚Äù project raising finance to produce an original anime series called ‚ÄòIsekai island‚Äô, a

NFT marketplace and a play-to-earn game all on the same platform. Having partnered with Strawberry Hill

Music and having the who‚Äôs who of Anime industry like Mika Kobayashi (of Attack on Titan fame), Raj Ramayya, Cherami Leigh, Morgan Berry, and Kira Buckland on their panel, with integrated characters and a

multitude of well-known cosplayers, a prolific ecosystem and an army of members on their Telegram channel forming the backbone of this unique venture; it remains to be seen when (not ‚Äòif‚Äô) Ecchicoin will open the floodgates of decentralized finance for upcoming talented movie-makers to make

their passion projects a reality without having the need to hand-out cheap freebies and hats in return!

THE CRYPTO

The team behind it wants to build a movement, where you can be part of. They are focusing on building a new brand, which will encompass a series of P2E games(tower defense, adventure, metaverse based on their proprietary IP), they reward holders constantly with airdrops and prizes like special NFTs, ANIME WALLET is getting filled to start the production of their own anime series aimed to be released on big streaming companies.

&#x200B;

ECCHI COIN has so many special and unique plans and that is only possible with hard work and the support of our community. They are sure that we will be fast a very strong community which believes in their work and see how much they are dedicated through their daily VC on telegram. They have been working on that vision for the past 8 months and will do all it takes to make it happen.

The team plans to become a reference on the anime and crypto gaming community.

"EJECT [$500,000 market cap] [5 days old] Crowdfunding Platform to Put an End to Rugpulls","# Are you sick and tired of being rugpulled? So were founders of [EJECT.Space](https://EJECT.Space)

# EJECT is a crowdfunding platform where investors meet new altcoin projects - SAFELY.

&#x200B;

Market Cap at $500k and 1,500 Real HODLERS.

Website:¬†[www.eject.space](http://www.eject.space/)

Telegram:¬†[https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity](https://t.me/EjectElonCommunity)

**What Is Eject Elon (EJECT)?**

EJECT will be the Kickstarter type crowdfunding platform built on the Binance smart chain. On EJECT, retail investors will find up and coming block-chain projects to invest in.

Instead of private sales, presales, airdrops, audits and marketing being done separately by each individual team on a variety of platforms, EJECT will host each phase of the growth of a Coin.

$EJECT is the native utility token that will be used for:

**Developers:**

* To Create and Launch projects

**Investors:**

* To back projects
* To invest in projects
* To trade $EJECT for the project's tokens or get rewarded in EJECT tokens

**Why Will EJECT be The Next 500x Token?**

Unlike many new projects, EJECT has a real world use-case RIGHT NOW! If you are a meme-coin/shit-coin investor, you know the drill. When making an investment decision, you have to:

¬†¬†¬† 1. Find projects that won't rugpull and those that won't be burnt to ashes 3 hours after launch.  
¬†¬†¬† 2. Scout the Internet for decent upcoming pre-sales without there being any centralized hub to find them.  
¬†¬†¬† 3. Leave a project as soon as you've 5x'd because you know they're mostly just pump and dumps.  
¬†¬†¬† 4. Rely on the hype, telegram members, poocoin ads, the relentless Reddit spam to find these projects.

**Right?**

And that is why the future EJECT platform ALREADY has a ready market of hundreds, if not thousands of investors/ day traders/ moonshot hopefuls who are looking for a place where reliable information is conveniently available, and where investing is easy and safe!

**The way things are RIGHT NOW:**

Under our noses, genuine developers with great projects and a vision go unnoticed because few con-men have learned the art of MARKETING and pulling the rug after launch.

Imagine a marketplace where the success of a new project is not decided by the marketing that goes into it, but the actual use-case? A place where you can access all the best new crypto projects, learn everything about them, interact through verified channels with the dev team, and invest with great convenience and speed if convinced by the project.

This also applies to shitcoins or memecoins because, as the community rules, any project that gets backing can see the light.

Our care is for the best to come to the limelight, irrespective of shenanigans and marketing budgets. We propose to host AMAs on our website, where developers can discuss their ideas with investors, and impose an auditing process for all projects that want to get listed on EJECT.

**How will EJECT achieve its goal?**

EJECT will be a centralized platform where potential investors will be able to see the latest pre-audited projects. The EJECT token will be the currency for backing a project through their private sales or presales. EJECT will also manage airdrops and reward customers who stake EJECT tokens and complete shilling tasks.

With the EJECT token as the currency and a prerequisite for backing projects, there is a REAL world use case for $EJECT, thereby attracting more holders and elevating the price of the EJECT token.

**When will EJECT Development start?**

We have started to document the project already. The development of the platform will start in late June 2021 and a beta version will likely be launched in early August 2021.

The platform will use the same type of safety mechanism that DxSale uses. No one, not even the platform developers, will be able to access the raised funds outside the rules and timelines agreed upon by investors and project leaders.

Currently, **EJECT has a Market Cap of $500K, with 1,500 REAL HOLDERS.**

"A hidden Gem I invested in presale is now on pancakeswap! With 1000x potential, don‚Äôt miss it!","Luminos mining protocol just got listed few days ago!
the project is very promising and has a very clear road map ahead.

It has a very warm community with strong management and development team.
I am one of the holders and i am here to share why i invested in this project.

First of all, technically wise, they have locked their LP, and 30% of their tokens are burnt.

founder is keeping as little as 1% share of the token, the rest are all for staking rewards.

Majority of the token holders are staking their token.

In LUMI farm , you can also stake your lumi to farm other upcoming project that went on initial farm offering with LUMI.

LUMI also has its own native launch pad , and the team of developers in LUMI will do the vetting and background check on project founder to ensure project is safe for community to invest.

In LUMI project, they are always trying to bring in new utility that connects the crypto world to offline businesses.
Their partners are all industrial giants in different field and with decades of experience.

Team wise, LUMI has one of the most friendly admin and support.
The lead developer is also a very down to earth person who always communicate with community about his vision and plans.
He always execute things that he has promised the community and is very genuine and real.

In terms of the company, LUMI is by two of the reputable companies, one is Geneva Capital Singapore, a corporate financing company specialized in helping companies to go on IPO - NASDAQ and more.
Luminos Graha Group, a nickel mining company in indoneisa who has collaboration with central sulawesi governor and conducts profitable nickel mining business to feed global demand in Nickel especially during this time where Nickel is the key materia needed to make car batteries for electric car companies such as Tesla.

The prospect of the business is great and the team is good. 
This is what made me invested into this amazing project.
And most importantly the community is warm and fun.

SmugDoge is the very first equivalent of the famous Doge coin, but launched on the Harmony One blockchain. Based upon the tried and tested SafeMoon contract, SmugDoge is a deflationary and reflective rewards token!

Details on how to buy are available on our medium post [Medium](https://link.medium.com/VC9GtYvE2kb) or if you are already familiar with the harmony ecosystem you can use this [Buy Link](https://game.defikingdoms.com/#/marketplace?outputCurrency=0x44aFdBe2Cb42cc18759159f7E383afb0Ca8E57aD)  

 

**FUTURE PLANS**

\-A DEX will be shortly launched

\-NFTs are planned

\-Staking with xSMUG to follow. As people cannot buy xSMUG, they will be unable to farm on the DEX without owning SMUG, and trading it for xSMUG. Therefore all transactions will benefit SMUG holders and add to an ever-increasing price floor which will be happening MULTIPLE TIMES PER SECOND once the DEX launches.

"Generic DOGE üê∂ | Our Doxxed team brings you the best MiniDoge Fork | No nonsense, One goal: The Moon","In the past few months, thousands of new crypto tokens have been created on the Binance Smart Chain. These projects had different concepts and Tokenomics, various names and different marketing approaches, but they all have one thing in common: The shape of their chart on PooCoin, an inverted parabolic curve. Why is that?¬†

Most projects promise the Moon: a high-risk high-return approach, which is heavily based on hype, marketing, and encourages investors to get in early and drop their investment rapidly.¬†

Many projects have attempted to hide and fight this cycle, but very few have succeeded. Even the powerhouses with massive marketing budgets have reached their peaks and are now as low as they started.

By channeling the strength of our community, GDOGE is the first project on the Binance Smart Chain that is not scared to be fully honest with its investors. All anyone wants is to Moon, and for that, community members and developers alike have to play their part: Shill, marketing, shill, marketing, and more shilling.¬†

Every day, the community is asked to complete a precise set of shilling tasks and consulted in regard to marketing decisions. Thanks to the 4% Marketing fee in our Tokenomics, this project is guaranteed to prolong the initial stages of ""hype"" and attract new investors, while converting early-stage investors into long-term holders. We're here to stay. If you believe in our philosophy, join our movement.¬†

Coupled with the revolutionary feature from MiniDOGE, which is a smart buyback function that only enables after an algorithm estimates that the chart is taking a ‚Äúdip‚Äù and should therefore be corrected, we are confident that Generic DOGE is the next big thing.

A second primordial feature for any token project which wishes to survive the test of time is the tax which automatically converts BNB and sends it to a Marketing Wallet. Marketing is the most important factor in the growth and life of a coin. Having a marketing fee that is sent to a wallet is the difference between a short-term and long-term project. Running out of Marketing funds is synonymous with the end of a project, and having a ‚Äúmarketing wallet‚Äù is inefficient in that sense. Having a marketing fee, however, guarantees that as long as trading volume is reasonably high, some funds are being put at the service of marketing and growth.

Generic Doge is launching in a few days. We've worked on this for hundreds of manhours, to guarantee a structured Marketing approach and to put our community at ease. Our Developer wallet will be fully locked for a month, and our liquidity will be locked for a year. The supply which will not be sold in the presale will be burned. 

Nothing has been left unaccounted for. This is, we think, the next MoonShot.

üî•Flokishima | Showcasing the game Flokishima Style | Next 1000x Potential Coin üöÄ | Presale 17th October 22:30 PM UTCüî•," 

What is it?

We are not aiming for the moon‚Ä¶. We are aiming to shatter through it. Flokishima is going to create the fusion needed to fuel our dynamic community on our BSC mission.

Our presale is being marketed with experience and power to generate the most interest that is possible for the project. We have Messiah launching us along with an ongoing Weibo campaign and this is just the start.

The future?

We have a team of experienced marketeers, both in and out of the BSC space. Pairing this along with a substantial marketing budget for billboards, adverts, and influencer partnerships, we are sure we‚Äôre going to be taking off, Poocoin Weibo twitter and multiple coinvote sites already up and running! Nfts and a game platform that is already in the early stages of development and will be with you along this amazing journey.

Keep your eyes open, this is going BIG!

What are the tokenomics?

Fairly simple; there is a 12% total transaction fee compromising of:

üí∞ 3% distributed to all holders.

Not only do you get to be part of the newest movement, you get rewarded every time someone buys or sells. Every buy and sell 3% gets paid to our holders in reflections. In short, the longer you hold the more tokens you earn.

üí∞ 3% added to the liquidity pool

The contract accumulates tokens on buy/sells and then adds them to the liquidity pool to create a solid price floor and increases the stability of the token for everyone's benefit!

üí∞ 6% sent to a house wallet

A token is nothing without it‚Äôs marketing power and development team. Not only do we have a substantial budget to start, we want the snowball to keep the momentum. We have a large sum of funds set aside and some very generous offerings from the doge community. Following initial advertisements and presale, we want multiple exchange listings and celebrity endorsements to help with rocket fuel for the moon.

What else?

Floishima is fully against rug pulls and honey pots, so he‚Äôs decided to give the community as much confidence as possible by:

Locked liquidity

Removing functions that could cause a honeypot from the contract and keep our investors protected

No separate dev or whale wallets that could crash the price

Getting a smart contract audit very soon

As soon as the world starts to know what Flokishima is doing, nothing can stop us.

"EverRise $RISE - Introducing unique tokenomics: Bringing the BuyBack concept into Crypto - 13 days old - 46,4K holders","EverRise is the orginal and first ever buy-back hyper-deflationary token on the BSC. 
**The same way SafeMoon paved the way for thousands of other coins to introduce the redistribution to holders, EverRise is the first to introduce this BuyBack feature. **

In the stock market environment, BuyBack means buying back the shares of a company in the open market, which increases the value of the stock. 

**At EverRise, we chose to apply the Buyback concept to cryptocurrency, and make our token more attractive to hold.**

On the EverRise protocol, a 6% transaction fee is stored in the contract and used periodicallly to buy back tokens from the market and then instantly burn them, increasing the value of the circulating supply. 

**The fees collected by the Contract are used to buyback and burn tokens when market conditions are bad, instantly increasing the price and saving the holders from massive dumps when is necessary.**

The token holders are benefited also through a 2% static rewards.

EverRise is working on two dApps: EverOwn and EverLock. Those projects will solve problems on the crypto industry and will be a source of revenue for the project and the holders.

**PRESALE LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT**

**We‚Äôve raised approximately 250 BNB to date.  There is only 78 BNB left to raise, period, and it‚Äôs going fast. We are also allocating a portion of this 78 BNB to a launchpad (announced today in our TG) for additional exposure.  When this allocation is gone, it‚Äôs gone, and after that it will have to be purchased post launch.**

**Visit** [https://t.me/PumpOfficialGroup](https://t.me/PumpOfficialGroup) **to get all the details!**

**PUMP Token**

$PMP is a revolutionary new token that is the first in ALL of DeFi to pair 75% of xSurge's $xUSD in LP as a backing asset. $xUSD is a stablecoin that only appreciates in value, giving pumptoken a unique stability unlike anything else seen on the BNB Smart Chain. A potentially revolutionary investment, Pump Token will  be a technology demonstrator for the future of decentralized stablecoin backed assets.  For a primer on $xUSD and what it is, visit buytherise.com

**WTF is $xUSD?**

$xUSD is DeFi's first ever appreciating and decentralized stablecoin that never goes down in price. Buys, sells and transfers all RAISE the price.  Interestingly, because of the wrapping mechanism inherent in $xUSD, buys and transfers raise the price linearly, however, selling the token actually raises the price exponentially.

$xUSD's real-world utilities generate revenue on its own via staking, lending, yield farming, mining, and arbitrage. These utilities create a paradigm shift from immediate price action to a sustained base APY that appreciates over time, all while abiding by XSurge's core truths:

* Every Buy, Sell Or Transfer Raises The Price
* Over 100% Liquidity Backing

$xUSD cannot be compared to a stablecoin like Tether.  $xUSD is fully collateralized, and it‚Äôs immutable.  For example, if 100 people bought $xUSD, and then 99 of them sold, the last man standing would not only walk out with full value, but would walk out with the best price.  Ironically (and quite extraordinarily) a huge selloff of $xUSD would cause the price to go parabolic in the upwards direction.The characteristics of $xUSD make it the PERFECT token to back ANY project on the BSC.  No matter what is happening with $PMP, $xUSD will always be going up in the background.  This is vitally important because ALL tokens go through bearish stretches and low volume periods.  $xUSD is the hedge against a down market and low volume.

**Why Buy Pump?**

**1. $xUSD backing and rewards:**

In addition to being backed 75% by $xUSD, $PMP gives 50% of all tax revenue back to our holders in $xUSD rewards.The longer you hold $PMP, the more rewards you will accumulate.  And getting rewarded in a token that cannot fall in price increases the incentive to keep on stacking those rewards and creating passive income.

$PMP is the FIRST token to pair such an extraordinary amount of LP in $xUSD, but it will not be the last.  Within a couple years, $xUSD will be THE premiere backing asset in all of the BSC.  $PMP holders will be the beneficiaries of every single project that uses $xUSD after it.

**2. Arbitrage:**

$PMP will launch with TWO liquidity pools!  Why?  Because we can profit off of price balancing between the two pools (arbitrage).

Our exclusive PumpBot (powered by XSurge‚Äôs Arbie) will be FEE EXEMPT, and will arbitrage the two pools 24/7.  90% of all arbitraged profits are returned back to $PMP.  This is an external revenue source for $PMP that will not require the token to be actively traded.  We can use that money for advertising, giveaways, buy and burns, wherever we feel the money can be deployed best‚Ä¶.and the service is FREE for us, we pay nothing to use it.

**3.  The Pumpstarter:**

The Pumpstarter is our exclusive Treausry deployment model.  We will allow our own community to participate in deciding the future direction of $PMP!  The community is a HUGE part of $PMP‚Äôs identity, and we want them actively engaged in deciding the best deployment of the Treasury‚Äôs funds.

Initially, all Treasury funds will be housed in $xUSD for safekeeping, so the Treasury will begin to grow right at launch.

**4.  Future projects:**

Although we cannot divulge exactly what‚Äôs next in store for $PMP, we are actively working on the next three or four phases of the project.  The whole game doesn‚Äôt begin and end with the launch of $PMP.  $PMP is just the beginning.

* 8% Referral Bonus

**The Game**

The BUSD Coffee Shop is a unique decentralized yield farming app on Binance Smart chain. In The BUSD Coffee Shop, the object of the game is to hire more Baristas before your fellow players can. Baristas work tirelessly for you, earning 10% of their value daily in coffee, which the user then sells for BUSD, the more baristas you have, the more you earn.

Baristas that are bought are no longer tradeable, and the investment made to re-hire them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, Baristas will never stop producing yield and with 10% of their value earned daily, after 10 days they will have earned their weight in Coffee. In Addition, to further encourage the community to re-hire/compound, there will be an additional 3% bonus for each compound action that the user will do, which can stack up to 40% for 10 consecutive times / 5 days. By doing so, this will ensure the long term potential profit of every investor. Please check the website for further clarification on the rules of the game.

**Contract**

The BUSD Coffee shop contract is renounced and completely decentralized and has be audited to ensure that players can compete fairly. But as with any project with high rewards, there are also high risks, so make sure to do thorough research before investing.

The BUSD Coffee Shop has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals.

The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your ""profit"" to be full of rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once.

Harold Coin | 1Mil+ MCAP | Liquidity locked | 1% to charity | Final call before CMC/CG listing!,"***What is it?***

We‚Äôre Harold Coin, based on the globally renowned ‚ÄúHide the Pain Harold‚Äù meme! Not only do we hold the name but we‚Äôre in talks with Andr√°s‚Äôs team to fully endorse the project which would be huge! The first meme coin backed by the meme!

***What are the tokenomics?***

The tokenomics were considered in depth to give the best chance of making the project a long term success, rather than the common ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù schemes.

10% total transaction fee compromising of:

**üí∞ 1% sent to a charity wallet**

Why not do some good along the way? 1% of all transactions are sent as BNB to the charity wallet shown here: https://bscscan.com/address/0x95b29d91a0c2d70c120608240af2f75391ffb70d#internaltx

Every month we let the community decide on which charity that gets the pot, big or small! We‚Äôre currently in talks with a small children's charity in Arizona where a benefactor is offering to match our $10,000 donation!

**üí∞ 1% sent to a marketing wallet**

In order for long term success, we need a way to fund marketing campaigns, development fees and more. We decided to send it to a wallet as BNB directly rather than hold a large bag of $HAROLD. This prevents having sell offs that decrease the price and makes it better for Harodlers!

**üí∞ 4% paid in reflection**

Similar to other coins, whenever there is a buy or sell, 4% of the fees are distributed to Harodlers in something known as proportional reflection. The longer you hold, the more you earn!

**üí∞ 4% added to the liquidity pool**

The contract accumulates tokens on buy/sells and then adds them to the liquidity pool to create a solid price floor and increases the stability of the token.

***Who are we?***

A mix of talent from software engineer, designer, financier to business developer. Fully doxxed as evidenced by the videos in our telegram! We are committed to making this token, the next big thing in the crypto space.

***What has been done so far?***

We had a fair launch (no presale), which was incredibly smooth. We‚Äôve had a couple of pumps, a couple of dumps but the overriding thing you will see looking at the graph is the steady, stable gradual uptrend. We want this to get to the moon safely without people being left behind.

So far, we‚Äôve spent $10,000 on paid marketing to bring on board twitter promotion, TG promotion and YouTube promotion incoming. There is more in the bank so we can keep pushing the marketing as far as we can!

CG and CMC listing applied for!

***What‚Äôs next?***

More marketing! We‚Äôre committed to funding this project and making it as big as possible. We truly believe a 500x is possible and near a reality given time.

The next two things we are looking at after the initial marketing push are:

* A full smart contract audit
* Exchange listings, we have already been in contact with WhiteBit in regards to a potential partnership

Compact - All in one BSC token - Strong Holderbase - NFT Trading Card Game,"Compact features every single beneficial aspect of a BSC token. The distribution of Safemoon, the burn of Bonfire, the return of liquidity of Fox Finance, the charity aspect of Elongate, the lottery aspect of Lotto and the giveaway aspect of CluCoin, Compact has it all. It is basically the ultimate BSC token.

Compact has had an incredible rise today, it went up by more than 40% - it's about to hit the first 2 million MCAP milestone where 1000$ will be given out to one two of the current holders.

Compact is only a week old and has not had a downtrend yet. Even in the past week, it has been very stable. Therefore, the holderbase is already very happy with current updates. An AMA on Friday will clear any questions and a brandnew website will follow by the end of this week too. Marketing is slowly rolling out and the trading volume is rising. Moreover, a lot of marketing has been done in the presale, this is also the reason why Compact hasn't had any issues with the current market downfall. As an example, Canbroke, one of the biggest German influencers has already said that he bought Compact in one of his videos and he also made an instagram post about it.

But there are also already long term plans and a usecase for this token, by developing an NFT trading card game, the token is working with one the best 3D NFT artists to create an actual NFT trading card game for mobile phones, Windows and Mac. A preview of the trading card NFTs can be found in one of the daily updates which inform the holders on the latest news, issues and marketing steps.

Tokenomics:

\- Original supply: 100,000,000,000

\- Total tax on each swap: 12%

\- Distribution: 3%

\- Liquidity Pool: 3%

\- Marketing: 2%

\- Charity: 2%

\- Events: 2%

They\'ve banned it one time, and they\'re giving people a chance to opt out before they ramp up more and more enforcement.

About

JB PROTOCOL is a decentralized finance hub that plans to connect all the primary DeFi use-cases within one simple ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain. We are Audited Since day 0 From Solidity Finance and also Certik Audit and Certik Shield are on the way; avoiding the expensive fees, confusing interfaces, and centralized decision-making of many current platforms. So with these goals in mind, we've built a protocol with some unique features we believe will amplify the power of wealth accumulation for our users.

‚úÖ 100,000,000,000,000 TotalSupply
‚úÖ 20% Burned
‚úÖ 42% Presale
‚úÖ 36% PancakeSwap Listing
‚úÖ 2% Project Development Wallet (LOCKED)

By collateralizing our native token JBP to open un CDPs, users will be able to keep upside exposure to our token, while increasing their leverage through the loaned assets. These loans will allow users to further participate in the DeFi ecosystem and expand their profit potential. Delegated Vaults on non-native tokens are also in the pipeline.

We plan to build an AMM exchange which will bring even more liquidity into the protocol. This will gain us access to additional profitable opportunities for yield optimization, as well as create synergies with our other initiatives.

FullSendCrypto (FULLSEND) Brand new DeFi Token focusing on TWO Core Functions!,"The Full Send Trading App will consist of our Open Source Decentralized Trading Platform, whereby trading algorithm developers can publish their trading bots on the platform and users can purchase access to unlock the Trading Bot of their choice, in the asset class or market of their preference. 

&#x200B;

Profits will be split between the Trading Bot Developer who published, and the Liquidity Pool for the Full Send Token.

&#x200B;

Other major implementations:

\- Learning platform for crypto-noobs

\- NFT shop

Another function they are working on is trying to partner with the real life NelkBoys, FullSend legit!

\- Incorporating FullSend store onto the App

\- Utilizing FullSendCrypto to make purchases on FullSend merch, app, website, etc‚Ä¶

FROM THEIR WHITE PAPER

&#x200B;

The tokenomics currently;

TOTAL SUPPLY 1 000 000 000 000 000 

FOR FUTURE BURNS 50 000 000 000 000 

PRESALE ALLOCATION 604 651 162 790 698

1) RETURN TO HOLDERS: 5% is distributed to every wallet that holds Full Send on a percentage basis. WHY? This means the more Full Send tokens you hold the more you will receive! In theory, you are earning money just by holding. 

2) STABILIZER: 5% of each transaction automatically adds it to the liquidity pool. WHY? The liquidity pool will continuously increase, which leads to a higher price floor of Full Send. 5% liquidity helps stabilize the price. Therefore, if a big holder wanted to sell, it would not affect price as much as if there was no liquidity there. 

3) BURNS: 1% of each transaction travels to Asgard, a black hole - and are permanently removed from our circulation. Asgard is an inaccessible wallet that no one can enter. WHY? With fewer outstanding shares, the ratio of net income to shares becomes higher.

4) POSSIBILITY OF ADJUSTING TOKENOMICS: we hope in the future, with a collaboration with NelkBoys, we can provide Practical Utility by adjusting the Tokenomics of FullSendCrypto, to incorporate a redistribution fee towards a NelkBoys Foundation Charity Wallet. With this presented to them, with substantial funds, we believe a real partnership would be possible, and allow us to help their brand, and help our community and investors alike!

Bluzelle Coin - Should we start to buy and hold BLZ?,"Bluzelle was one of the most hyped ICOs of late 2017-18, ICO price was $0.12 for each token, and now, the price is around $0.1 only.

But I don't think the price of BLZ token dumped cuz of the company problem, I think it's a result of the bear market. The down-trend market makes some altcoins goes under its real value. And there's a chance for us to grab some good coins at the great price for holding purpose.

Have a look at Bluzelle Coin Total Supply, only 500.000.000 and Circulating Supply is 191.211.760 tokens. With that quantity, even if BLZ reaches $0,3 per token(mean 200% profit), the marketcap of Bluzelle Coin will be only around $ 60m. That's pretty low with a great company like Bluzelle - which was called the ""Oracle"" of Blockchain field and ""Global Fintech 100"" by H2 Venture. Don't forget that BLZ market cap reached $134m in May 2018, and 2018 is a bad year of cryptocurrency. So I believe when the market recovery, BLZ will get a spot in the Top 50.

**10,000 Holders broken! (+2300)**

Yesterday we grew our holder base by over 2300, our continued grow means we continue to break all-time highs and have increased growth.

We're celebrating our 10th day since launch!

**What makes us different?**

We're 100% community driven, and we want to focus on utility. We're trying to 'do things right' rather than gain quick traction. This meant we went through two full audits prior to launch. Following that we renounced ownership and completed a third audit.

There have been no risks found you can read more here: [TECHRATE.ORG](https://techrate.org/) \- [http://xspace.finance/XSPACE.pdf](http://xspace.finance/XSPACE.pdf) \- [https://solidity.finance/audits/xSpace/](https://solidity.finance/audits/xSpace/)

We focused on creating a healthy project, which means we research every step to ensure we don't fail where other projects may have historically.

At xSpace currently we are looking to shortlist charities to stretch our philanthropic arm in the coming weeks to ensure our project also gives back to great causes.

**Listings**

* We've achieved over 1000 votes on Blockfolio and hope to be listed soon.
* This week we saw ourselves added to UniRocket at our communities request.
* Our application with CoinGecko has been approved and we'll be listed at some point this week.
* CoinMarketCap is still under processing.

**xSpace Exchange**

On the 18th-25th April we're going to be launching our very own xSpace exchange where you can convert between different Cryptocurrencies, this gives much needed utility to our project. We have been planning this months before our official launch!

**App Development**

We are also launching an Android and iOS app as a staggered launch, the Android app will be released at the tail-end of this month, with iOS following in early may. We want our project to be accessible anywhere. To begin with the apps will have the basic functionalities specific to our project (more details to follow), however we'll be rolling out improvements in following iterations.

**Community Driven**

We are 100% community driven, no developer tokens are present and we have a nice distribution of wallets. We are targeting organic growth that leads to a sustainable project in the DeFi space.

xSpace has just reached 11,338 holders on day 10! we'd like to thank each and every one of our loyal holders.

We're currently 10 days old with a $10.7M Market Cap, and we have 11,338 Holders as of writing!

RISKMOON 3 Days Old BSC token with NFT Marketplace and more coming up,"RISMOON is a rapidly deflationary token on BSC. It's got an NFT marketplace and much more coming up soon

Reason why this might go parabolic :

1. Still in early stages under 1M$ Marketcap, listed less than 4 days ago
2. Dev team credible and highly skilled based in US, KYCed (doxxed) by multiple people
3. Has an awesome NFTs marketplace with loan functionality and a virtual game coming up like MyNeighbourAlice on Binance (which shot up 20000%)
4. 15% tax on each transaction incentivises everyone to HODL
   1. 10% is Redistributed to all HODLERS
   2. 5% is added to the Locked Liquidity Pool
5. More marketing activity in April
6. See Crypt\_Pens opinions on this here: [https://twitter.com/Crypto\_Pen/status/1376270299218522114](https://twitter.com/Crypto_Pen/status/1376270299218522114)

Experts have been saying that the best way to get out of a slumping market is by investing in high-potential tokens.,"Professional investors are looking for suitable investments to boost their portfolio and earn profit when the market recovers.

So while investors are expecting high performance from tokens like Tezos (XTZ), Decentraland (MANA), and RoboApe (RBA), there are some crypto tokens that are presenting other attractive rewards to their buyers.

For instance, LuckyBlock is a play-to-earn Crypto Game Token that is offering daily rewards to its players and customers. TokLok is also offering its buyers free access to the one of the highest security ensured messaging applications. It is also offering other attractive bonuses for the buyers of the TOL token.

\*\*\*Together we can protect the forests and save the planet!\*\*\*

Each year, millions of acres of forests around the world are either destroyed, degraded by wildfires or are lost to logging and agriculture. The importance of forests are far greater than we think, we depend on forests for our livelihood and for the animals that we graze. This has inspired us to create a charity focused token that incentivizes the average joe to donate to charities that are focused on rebuilding our forests. Our mission for this project is to save at least 900 forests around the world by the end of 2022 and we can only accomplish this with your help. When you buy or sell $forest, you pay a 10% fee with 3% of that going into the charity wallet, 2% burned forever and the remaining 5% back to the holders. Just by holding on to this token, you can generate great yields by those that trade the token. The donations will take place every two weeks

No matter how big the data storage solution is, it still remains vulnerable to attacks. The issue with relying on such a solution is that attackers \\*only\\* have to break the defences of one data storage entity to compromise it.\r  \n\r  \nDecentralized solutions work differently. To put it simply: data is encrypted and stored across several locations. \r  \n\r  \nIf you‚Äôve hung around Crypto Twitter (CT), you might have witnessed a huge number of cyber attacks on crypto protocols. In 2021 only protocols have lost billions of dollars in hacks & scam. This is why it‚Äôs important for web3 apps to build on decentralized infrastructures such as Point Network that facilitate storing data on decentralized storage solutions. \r  \n\r  \nIf you need additional reasons for going for decentralization, consider that centralized entities can decide to halt providing services any time they want‚Ä¶ Just look at what happened to the Parler app last year, and you‚Äôll understand that centralized entities have become way bigger than we should have let them.', ""Some auto companies has been exploring blockchain and how it will benefit them better than centralized systems. BMW has tested blockchain to track the mileage of leased vehicles. They also in collaboration with GM explore sharing of self-driving cars data.\n\nAndre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk:\n\n*‚ÄúWith the advent of blockchain, decentralized data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way. Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.‚Äù*\n\nSebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI‚Äôs vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:\n\n*‚ÄúThe old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.‚Äù*\n\nThey'll be exploring this through Ocean Protocol, which is also a member of MOBI."", 'Because the attacker only need to infiltrate one storage facility compare that to decentralized storage where even if one storage point is compromised, you have other facilities to fact check the data and use as a reference to restore the compromised one.', 'Storage on the decentralized platform is secure and everlasting. It also does not necessitate a large investment in data centers, making it less expensive than centralized storage solutions. Controlling and storing functions are simple, especially when employing storage platforms such as OCEAN, FIL, and AR.', ""The protocols for decentralized storage generally make it easy for smaller providers to provide a good service. IPFS is an easy one to play with if you're interested in learning more."", ""Consider the benefits of a single centralised database. Just a single MySQL or MariaDB server hosting all your data. What metrics could you measure it by?\n\n- speed\n- security\n- resistance to failure\n- capacity\n\nA single server will be our reference point, so let's say it scores 1 unit on all of these categories. The scale is entirely arbitrary but will be useful as a benchmark.\n\nNow, presume we have two identical servers running in parallel that somehow synchronise with each other. In that case, we compromise a bit on speed, since we are using some amount of time to synchronise, and you cannot process at a speed greater than 1 unit, because in that case, they will never be able to catch up and synchronise. In addition, you also compromise on capacity, since you are using (and paying for!) enough disk space to store 2 units, but you can only store 1 unit (maybe even less due to synchronisation overhead) because you have one copy of the same data on each server. You do, however, have a system that is twice as reliable, since two servers need to crash for your system to go down, instead of just one.\n\nNow consider four servers. The speed goes down a little bit again due to synchronisation overhead, but maybe not as much of a penalty as going from 1 server to 2 servers. Capacity also decreases from ¬Ω to ¬º, since you are now maintaining four copies of the same data. But now, your system is extremely reliable, and it's unlikely that it's going to ever go down if your four servers are located around the world. You also get an increase in security, since if the data on one server is tampered with, it becomes immediately obvious since the other three won't agree with it. An adversary would need to tamper with the data on at least two servers now to confuse the system.\n\nA blockchain is like scaling this system to a million servers. Eventually, the penalty for adding new servers in terms of cost to speed bottoms out. The blockchain *is* a way to synchronise unlimited servers with each other. It's also impossible to tamper with. Nobody can modify the data on one, ten, or even a hundred thousand servers without it being rejected overall by the remaining 900,000. You also get a benefit where every action is cryptographically signed, but that is not an intrinsic benefit of the blockchain. Rather, every cryptocurrency has just independently found it useful to implement such a feature.\n\nThe downsides remain the same. The Ethereum network is only capable of handling around ten transactions per second, an abysmal speed compared to a single MySQL server which can execute thousands of queries a second even on unimpressive hardware. Additionally, every Ethereum node maintainer keeps a 300+ GB copy of the blockchain, which actually only ends up containing maybe around 50 GB of actual data if it was stored in an optimally efficient manner, without a blockchain. So at the end of the day, you have 300+ PB of hard disk space around the world being used to store duplicate data. But since every node maintainer pays their own costs, the pain is spread so widely that it really doesn't matter as much.\n\nEdit: There is also a downside specific to Ethereum and cryptocurrency blockchains. The network charges you a fee (gas fee) to modify the data, and this can cost into the order of several dollars per update. Even at its cheapest on side chains, it's still upwards of a penny per dozen or so updates. That's hellishly expensive compared to centralised solutions."", 'company can easily ban you and delete all your content.', ""It all boils down to the fact that you don't own your data and you cannot really guarantee privacy.

The tech community on the other hand seems to be looking at it from a different point of view. There are expectations with regards to the incorporation of Web3 and the metaverse as a whole.

While this is all happening, it wouldn‚Äôt be far-fetched to call Chainge Finance a visionary project. For those unaware, Chainge Finance recently launched a new feature that enables users to send their crypto assets via their Twitter handle. It is needless to say that the doors of opportunities have become unhinged at this point.

You can find out more about the project and how to use the new feature on their website.

It gets kinda dystopian if you get into the rabbit whole of how politics and power affect our every day life so I view decentralized web3.0 as a hope of true freedom and almost as a ‚Äúresistance‚Äù to controlling governments. \n\nAfter all, we all give the value to the cryptos, and don‚Äôt have to go back to fiat if we are all in accordance to it having an absolute value; hence them not even getting $$$ from taxes (preferably with a stable coin).

The government and public companies are in too deep to allow the people control"", 'Agreed. \n\nWell even web3.0 through government control still will be a thing so there that for its ‚Äúpotential‚Äù you didn‚Äôt seem to find.']"

What's the most important use case for Web3?,"Web3 as commonly known refers to the third generation of the internet, which is focused on decentralization. There are several uses of Web3 which includes:

1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Web3 is being used to develop decentralized finance applications that offer financial services without the need for intermediaries like banks. All DeFi projects belong here. 

2. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Web3 is enabling the creation and trading of third generation NFTs, i.e. composable NFTs. An example of a project doing this is Fusion by Metaplex. 

3. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Web3 is facilitating the creation of DAOs, which are organizations that are run by code and governed by their members. This enables decentralized decision-making and eliminates the need for traditional corporate structures. E.g. MakerDao, PhoenixDao etc.

4. Crypto Payment: The existence of Web3 tech now made it possible for payments on blockchain to include NFTs and metaverse assets among the list of options (in addition to cryptocurrencies) to redeem payment.  CryptMi is a project that belongs here. I see this as the most important use for web3, cus bill payment cuts across the daily life of human beings. 

5. Identity and Data Management: Web3 is being used to create decentralized identity solutions that give users more control over their personal data and privacy. See EverestID.

Would like to know your take on the use cases for Web3 tech  and which one you think is the most pivotal.",yesifebewr,web3,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/12ja052/whats_the_most_important_use_case_for_web3/,1681273978.0,43,53,20,"[""The biggest use case of web3 is IMO, trust less self executing contracts.\n\nIt'll make a lot of things that are more sensitive and personal, automated with no human interaction ever.\n\nThis paired with Zero Knowledge proofs would be huge for privacy and digital safety."", ""I'm not sure if there is a winner.

Appchains and interoperability in web3,"Hello everyone, Im a crypto investor but I have recently been trying to get into developing, and have been doing a lot of research. I thought I could ask some questions about app chains and their meaning for the future of web3. 

It seems to me like the future of web3 is going to be determined by interoperability between projects. There are so many different chains and mechanisms that it will be necessary to allow for easy cross-comaptibility, and this seems like a space that could be useful/lucrative to enter. 

Im super bullish on NEAR with investments and the only real example I know of this tech is appchains supported on the Octopus Network. Appchains built on Octopus are compatible with NEAR, ethereum and IBC blockchains which gives projects in web3 the potential to reach a wider audience. 

I want to know what other networks or protocols offer interoperability as cornerstones of their design, or if anyone thinks Im totally off base. There are also reasons to think that single blockchains could rise above all others and dominate the industry.

Some thoughts on business models for web3,"**Web 3 isn't business as usual.**¬†

On the contrary, Web 3 will spawn entire new types of businesses, all because of 3 fundamental truths.

* Everything is tradable
* Customers are investors
* Governance is programmable

**Everything is tradable.**

Anything can be priced and traded against anything else. Exchange your u/BoredApeYC for a house or a college degree, exchange your game item for an airline ticket.

**Customers are investors.**

Web 3 is community first. You don't build a product for a market, you build consensus around an idea in collaboration with the customers/users. The customers are rewarded with tokens/ownership for their early support and participation...

**Governance is programmable**

Countries, organisations and individuals all organize rules and the ability to enforce them. Web 3 makes the ability to organize and enforce much more granular by making everything that can be computed a potential law.

So why is that a big deal?...

Because compared to the old world where that is very expensive, slow and difficult. DAO's are regulation, voting, and enforcement in a box.¬†

Any idea you have can be governed through consensus allowing for completely new ways of organizing.¬†

&#x200B;

Lets look at a few examples:

**Funding for game development**

A group of game developers pitch the game they want to build and what it will cost them.

* They offer tokens as avatars in the game for those who want to support the development of the game, let's say 10000 for $100 each which provides $1million...
* The $1M will be divided and unlocked in stages.
   * Proof of concept
   * Alpha
   * Beta
   * Launch
* Each stage met successfully will unlock funds for next stage.
* The token holders vote to unlock each stage.
* If there is no consensus to move forward the reaming funds will be returned. Or...
* If the token holders vote on continuing and unlocking the next phase and you voted against it you can try and sell your token to someone who believes in the project.

This level of fluidity is unprecedented and allow anyone to be an investor, co-creator and gamer simultaneously.

&#x200B;

**ACME Clothing Brand Launch**

* ACME NFT will serve as a lifetime pass for ACME clothes.¬†
* 1000 NFTs ever will be minted. You will receive clothing for each new season as long as you hold the token.¬†
* The value of the token increase with the¬†increase in the brand value
* You got some friends who like your hoodie? No problem. Just print a few more at a discount and sell or give it to them. It's your brand. You own the rights to it as long as you keep the token.
* Each new seasons clothing line will be voted by the 1000 token holder consensus...
* Don't agree with the new clothing line coming out? Saw another brand you like better? Sell your token to someone else on OpenSea and make someone else the new co-owner/creator of the now popular clothing brand.

&#x200B;

**Multi-company cross promotion**

3 different companies is doing cross promotion. They offer 20% discount if you buy from all 3.

* One is selling sneakers the other is selling trainers, the third is selling socks. The first place the customers buys a product they mint a token...
* 13/ The second place they go to, they show their token when they buy the product and it gets added to the NFT which now have two purchases on record.
* The third purchase unlocks the discount. The campaign revenue & rules are held in the DAO and unlocked once campaign is over.

Completely unrealistic in most current scenarios.

With Web3, companies can collaborate without trusting each other because the rules are written into the DAO and can't be coerced or changed once agreed upon.

To take this even further. The relationship between everyone is completely rewritten. There is no practical limits to how and who you can connect with and creating meaningful relationships.

If it can be programmed it can be governed.

Are you a noob in Web3 and NFTs like me? Wanna study them together?,"Hey guys. I'm looking for a study buddy/ies who wants to learn Web3 and NFTs with me.

I‚Äôve been going around the rabbit hole and joining communities this first half of January to learn Web3 and NFTs, and I‚Äôm completely overwhelmed. It seems that the trend of decentralization and crypto is conquering the internet. So many communities and content out there.

From a non-tech background, I‚Äôm planning to take it step-by-step, learning fundamentals to advanced. I‚Äôve found 2 relevant self-paced courses -- [Web3 Foundation's Youtube MOOC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxVihxZC42nF_MCN9PTvZMIifRjx9cZ2J) and NFT fundamentals in Udemy.

It‚Äôs easy to binge-watch these courses for sure, but I‚Äôm thinking that learning effectively is better with small groups. You'll probably gonna ask me why not enroll in cohort-based courses or just rely on communities. cohort-based courses are pretty expensive and most of them are for software dev. communities are great to learn but they are too big (10k+++) to learn and discuss synchronously.

Blockchain and crypto adoption is huge right now among individuals and developers,"Cryptocurrency adoption has reached a whole new level this year, and some research points to mora than 1 billion crypto users in 2024 worldwide.

These  numbers are no  surprise at all to me since now users can  publish, discover, and consume data in a secure, privacy-preserving  fashion, have data NFTs integrated which are the interface to connect  data assets with blockchain and DeFi tools, and represent the ownership  of the unique asset. 

Since Ocean Protocol V4 (Onda) has launched, dataNFTs have  been introduced on their platform - A data NFT is the representation of  the intellectual property on-chain, we call this the base-IP.

Gaming is the bridge to web3.,"Blockchain gaming has received attention in Web3 as of late, pulling in almost $750 million from venture capitalists in the first nine months of 2022 ‚Äî more than 50% of the total funding that has gone into crypto this year, according to DappRadar.  


Taylor Monahan, global product lead at MetaMask, told Blockworks that gaming is one of the most popular use cases on the wallet and has been since 2020.   


‚ÄúWith the pandemic, MetaMask has seen exponential growth in play-and-earn gaming, especially in the APAC \[Asia-Pacific\] region,‚Äù Monahan said.   


Even so, a recent study by CodaLabs revealed that traditional gamers, on the whole, aren‚Äôt fans of crypto or NFTs ‚Äî and rated their feelings toward the industry at an average of 4.4 out of 10. Only 15% of gamers who haven‚Äôt played a Web3 title showed interest in blockchain-based games.  


Games like Axie Infinity, CosmoGene, and recent projects like LifeBeyond have led GameFi to great heights which is certain to continue.  


The biggest hesitation around crypto gaming came from concerns about scams and the cost of Web3 gaming.   


Monahan is still bullish, though, saying the partnership ought to enable an ‚Äúeven smoother user experience‚Äù designed to make possible ‚Äúfull interoperability for Web3 games.‚Äù",TruNeby,web3,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/ylikrp/gaming_is_the_bridge_to_web3/,1667518433.0,16,37,2,"['So what web3 games you recommend?

Is Web 3.0 overhyped or the wave of the future?,"
Web3 is more about bringing physical assets into the digital age and allowing true digital ownership. People who say big tech won't allow it may be correct, but what about a new start-up that uses crypto to allow people to truly own the content they create? How can big tech compete if it doesn't adopt it? Is there a market for it? I'm not sure, but crypto enthusiasts seem to think so. It remains to be seen whether it is useful to the general public.

It's always been a truism in Silicon Valley that if you want to know where the next big ideas will come from, look where the money and smart developers are going. There has been no shortage of funds in the case of Web3. Only a few developers, on the other hand, have decided to jump on this bandwagon. Tea, a web 3 tool, was created by a number of well-known developers, including the creators of the homebrew tool.

Code-enforced contracts are possible with smart contracts. Digital assets can be owned using blockchain technology. In the world of finance, this is a game changer. Gaming assets are one example I'll use that people might be able to understand. You can work hard for items in a WoW game, putting in a lot of time and effort, but if Blizzard decides to ban your account for some arbitrary reason, you'll be out of luck. You don't have any rights to them. The blockchain enables you to truly own these items. Blizzard will not be able to take them away from you. On the blockchain, there are even assets that can be used in a variety of games.

They don't care what game they're playing. Before you say it won't catch on, keep in mind that it already has. These games are simple and entertaining, but it is an exciting space that is constantly evolving.
TL;DR: Blockchain isn't attempting to take the place of MySQL. It aims to eliminate counter-party risk by allowing digital ownership of all digital assets.

Decoding the Future: Account Abstraction Unveiled,"The evolution of blockchain wallets is underway, and one key player in this transformation is the concept of ""Account Abstraction."" Let's explore the significance of this feature and how Brillion Wallet is standing out by embracing it.  
  
Account Abstraction Defined: At its core, Account Abstraction is a concept that separates the control of an account from its ownership. This means users gain greater flexibility and control over their funds, a crucial step towards a more user-centric crypto experience.  
  
Unlocking New Possibilities: With Account Abstraction, Brillion Wallet users can enjoy a seamless and secure interaction with the blockchain. This feature opens the door to a myriad of possibilities, from simplified transactions to innovative dApps.  
  
Why It Matters: Traditional crypto wallets often lack the flexibility needed for diverse blockchain interactions. Account Abstraction changes the game by providing users with a more intuitive, user-friendly, and dynamic experience.  
  
Brillion's Unique Approach: In embracing Account Abstraction, Brillion Wallet distinguishes itself as a forward-thinking platform. By putting users in control and simplifying complex processes, it aligns with the vision of making blockchain accessible to everyone.  
  
Looking Ahead: The adoption of Account Abstraction is a key step towards the future of blockchain wallets. As Brillion continues to innovate and pave the way for user-friendly crypto experiences, it's evident that the significance of this feature will only grow.

The Potential of Non-Fungible Equity,"One of the major challenges facing DeFi is the issue of overcollateralization and illiquidity. As we look for innovative solutions, one concept that has caught my attention is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). This approach has the potential to revolutionize DeFi by addressing these pressing issues.

Within the realm of tokenizing real-world assets, there are several projects worth exploring, including mnicorp, Polytrade, realionetwork, and many others. These projects introduce novel models and approaches to incentivize user participation and tap into the untapped potential of tokenizing assets.

However, let's shift our focus to the fascinating concept of Non-Fungible Equity (NFE) and its role in bridging traditional businesses into the digital portfolio of DeFi.

NFE offers an inclusive opportunity for users to invest in a diverse range of real-world assets. With NFE, the traditional barriers of illiquidity and limited access are shattered, providing increased liquidity and broader investor participation. This groundbreaking approach allows users to stake on a variety of RWA projects that are chosen and funded by the community itself, ensuring sustainability and reducing concerns about liquidity.

The transparency and resilience of NFE in a decentralized environment make it a powerful tool in shaping the future of DeFi. By embracing NFE and exploring tokenization of real-world assets, we unlock numerous benefits, including improved transparency, reduced transaction costs, and wider access for investors.
Let's dive deeper into the potential implications and opportunities that arise from tokenizing real-world assets and harnessing the power of Non-Fungible Equity in the DeFi landscape.",krimmelnnd,web3,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/13m0nvs/the_potential_of_nonfungible_equity/,1684514188.0,16,33,16,"[""The tokenization of RWAs in DeFi is one of the narratives that opens up more opportunities for blockchain in future because that's the only way we can have traditional assets on chain for easy manipulation.

The Rise Of Web3: What Cybersecurity Concerns Should We Look Out For?,"Web3 is a slang name for the future generation of the internet, which includes cryptocurrency, decentralized networks, the blockchain, and other technologies. While the concept of Web3 may appear to many as a far-off, future concept, the truth is that it is far closer than we realize, with many features already firmly embedded in the public awareness. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)‚Äîvirtual money backed and issued by a central bank‚Äîhave previously been created in nine nations. What concerns should we look for?

Cryptojacking 

It doesn't take long for cybercriminals to jump on the bandwagon, as it does with all popular trends. RAV researchers revealed 2021 was ""the year of the miner"" in Reason Labs' State of Consumer Cybersecurity report. The number of crypto miners distributed throughout 2021 was enormous, accounting for nearly 60% of all Trojan activity detected last year. It's a threat that, while it may not harm a user's device like traditional malware, will directly affect a user's pocketbook‚Äîyour electric bill may skyrocket as crypto coins are harvested without your consent. Projects like Concordium have paved the way by ensuring that while users enjoy safety and privacy of transactions, it is possible to be used for police report when the need be.

Vulnerabilities in Blockchain 

There are legitimate security concerns with digital currency. The cryptocurrency blockchain, contrary to popular belief, is not an impenetrable force. It is secure when you or trusted sources operate the majority of a blockchain. However, if malicious miners control a simple majority of more than 51 percent of the blockchain, it breaks the chain, making it vulnerable to manipulation‚Äîand, worryingly, these so-called ""51 percent attacks"" are also on the rise. 

In 2020, bitcoin gold, a relatively minor cryptocurrency, was subjected to a 51 percent attack, resulting in the double-spending of over $72,000 in bitcoin gold tokens. And, just last month, the play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity was hacked to the tune of $625 million by hackers stealing from the underlying Ronin blockchain, raising the bar for crypto heists to shockingly high new heights Many in the cybersecurity industry would consider an event like this to be a learning experience, but it's a costly one!

Phishing Attacks 

Phishing is another threat that is likely to infiltrate the Web3 domain. Phishing is not a new concept; however, the way it is used today is. In October 2021, attackers used phishing emails to steal cryptocurrency from 6,000 Coinbase customer accounts by exploiting a flaw in the company's two-factor SMS system. Another malicious example of this type of theft occurred in February, when $1.7 million in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were stolen in an OpenSea phishing attack. An attack that exploited a flaw in the Wyvern Protocol, the standard that underpins most NFTs, stole over 250 tokens. 

The Importance of Education 

This brings us back to a topic I've discussed before: the importance of cybersecurity education. How do you prevent phishing scams? What exactly does it mean to be cyber secure? How do you have complete faith in something? It is critical to teach customers how to ask and answer these questions.

Learning to recognize suspicious signs will increase consumer awareness of the safety of their devices and data. 

Furthermore, next-generation antivirus (NGAV) and endpoint protection solutions are required. Attackers are constantly attempting to tip the scales of trust. To detect and eliminate new threats, we need to use a combination of the human brain, instinct, and AI machine learning.

Unfortunately, the ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and end-user ownership that Web3 will offer consumers is the same freedom that cybercriminals will also be able to enjoy. We need to find a solution whereby the vision of an autonomous web for all can be experienced, without opening up a huge can of worms.",Aggrgis,web3,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/v19fgm/the_rise_of_web3_what_cybersecurity_concerns/,1653943455.0,6,30,1,"['Can you go into dusting a bit?
