This is a coin I am genuinely passionate about and have been in from near enough day one ‚Äì the telegram community that has developed around it has to be one of the most tight knit I have experienced, and it is exciting that we are adding new members every day.¬† It has certainly been a rollercoaster journey so far and I am not promising a smooth journey, but I personally believe any investor getting in now will be very pleased long term. ¬† 

¬† 

To summarise, I feel this coin, with such a low market cap and with the ambition the developers have shown, is primed to moon üåï

¬† 

The most exciting thing is that we found out yesterday that the coin was approved for¬†Coin Market Cap listing¬†üìàüìà(searchable and can be added to watch list). This has been a huge goal for the developers and anyone getting in before the listing goes live (once we hit the required daily volume and marketcap) we will be there for everyone to see. We also saw the price go x10 when we went live on Coin Gecko a few weeks ago and Coin Market Cap is much larger. 

¬† 

We have also begun to see some real exposure with various youtubers covering us with many having over 100,000 subscribers. Here is one review:

A coin I have been in since the stealth launch which was ruined by whale & bot buyers and bad actors manufacturing a crash. We became a small community of core holders and have helped grow the coin since through spreading the word and holding strong with others seemed to not believe. The devs have worked tirelessly to deliver for the community and I firmly believe this has an extremely bright future and I can‚Äôt believe how early it is still. 

¬† 

There was naturally some initial FUD spread by bad actors around the coin but the team have vastly addressed these issues and gone out of their way to appease the community with decreasing the tax and locking the code whilst also delivering some huge announcements.

WIN: The reference for lottery tokens in the crypto sphere. A coin that already has a use-case! [0$ Market Cap],"**The project:**¬†

WIN ($TICKETS) aspires to become the most commonly known and recognized lottery token in the crypto sphere. In order for a cryptocurrency to grow and gain traction, especially in the Altcoin market, it must have a ‚Äòuse-case‚Äô, which only usually comes with the promise of a better future. Our team is motivated by the idea our coin will have a use-case from day one! The gambling industry has been around for centuries, and there will be an ever-growing crowd of ‚Äògamblers‚Äô and players in the crypto world, as cryptocurrencies slowly become the staple in terms of money transactions around the world. In order to support this transition, WIN wishes to establish itself as the most competitive and well-known lottery token in the industry, all the while progressively growing a following.¬†

**How it works:**

With WIN, the chances of winning are relative to how many tokens you hold, which means that all holders are incentivized to buy more tokens in the long term if they wish to increase their chances of winning the lottery.¬†

In addition, the requirement to be eligible at winning the lottery is relatively low, at the value of 777,777 tokens, which means all holders are incentivized to HODL in the hopes of winning a huge prize.¬†

Chances of winning will be calculated in indirect proportion to how many tokens each holder has. This means that having more tokens does increase your chances of winning, but not in a linear fashion. Instead, a logarithmic function will be used to convert the proportion of holdings that each investor has, and calculate their chances of winning accordingly.¬†

This will lower the discrepancy in the probability of winning between a whale and a small investor while keeping our larger investors at an advantage.¬†

**A note on marketing:**

In the framework of the gambling industry, marketing plays a key driver for all the parties involved. For the organization, marketing attracts a larger pool of players who can participate in the activities/lotteries. For the players, as more players are participating in the lotteries, this results in larger payouts being handed out. Since gambling is a high-risk, high reward activity, it is vital that a sufficient number of individuals are made aware of the present games in order to diversify the risks amongst the population of players.

In the case of WIN, the same applies, but with greater flexibility. Our ability to attract crypto investors as well as ‚Äògamblers‚Äô increases the impact of our marketing, but this is unfortunately counterbalanced by the fact that we need to spend on marketing on a daily basis, for the aforementioned reasons. In order for our venture to be successful in the long term, WIN needs a constant marketing push, which imposes a marketing expense as part of the prize wallet. The complete breakdown of how this is executed is given in the whitepaper on the WIN website.¬†

**Launch**

This coin is launching on Sunday, after hosting a private sale on Friday and a pre-sale on Saturday. With the current level of effort and transparency put into this project, this could be the next very big thing.¬†

$CRT apples 7% TAX on all transaction. and the fees are proportionally split and instantly distributed as rewards among all token holders.

&#x200B;

Why is Cryptoz launchpad? Meme/Microcap Launchpad necessary?

Currently, there is a void in the market for launchpads supporting smaller projects. Micro-cap projects include meme coins, small raises/launches and charity coins. If these projects were to approach a traditional launchpad, they would most likely be rejected due to small size and lack of allocation for the launchpads themselves. Cryptoz allows these projects to raise their liquidity for LP in a fast turnaround time, while enjoying all the benefits of a traditional launchpad.

PUGLIFETOKEN is an autonomous yield and liquidity generation protocol that aims to directly reward its holders whilst concurrently increasing liquidity.

4% Transformed into BNB/PUGLIFETOKEN LP Tokens, and added to liquidity.

1% goes to a wallet for marketing and further development

**Tocenomics**|

There will be a total of 1,000,000,000 PHUGS

25% will be distributed for 300 BNBs in the presale

What is the advantage of decentralized storage over centralized storage?," I don‚Äôt get the fuss over decentralized infrastructures. Take storage‚Ä¶ as a company, I‚Äôd rather trust a big corporation to store my data than a decentralized solution involving several smaller little-known entities to store them. I guess I‚Äôm missing something here?",Elemiadlikefe,web3,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3/comments/x79gnu/what_is_the_advantage_of_decentralized_storage/,1662467664.0,29,226,2,"['I get your point, but there remains a critical flaw in this way of thinking. No matter how big the data storage solution is, it still remains vulnerable to attacks. The issue with relying on such a solution is that attackers \\*only\\* have to break the defences of one data storage entity to compromise it.\r  \n\r  \nDecentralized solutions work differently. To put it simply: data is encrypted and stored across several locations. \r  \n\r  \nIf you‚Äôve hung around Crypto Twitter (CT), you might have witnessed a huge number of cyber attacks on crypto protocols. In 2021 only protocols have lost billions of dollars in hacks & scam. This is why it‚Äôs important for web3 apps to build on decentralized infrastructures such as Point Network that facilitate storing data on decentralized storage solutions. \r  \n\r  \nIf you need additional reasons for going for decentralization, consider that centralized entities can decide to halt providing services any time they want‚Ä¶ Just look at what happened to the Parler app last year, and you‚Äôll understand that centralized entities have become way bigger than we should have let them.', ""Some auto companies has been exploring blockchain and how it will benefit them better than centralized systems. BMW has tested blockchain to track the mileage of leased vehicles. They also in collaboration with GM explore sharing of self-driving cars data.\n\nAndre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk:\n\n*‚ÄúWith the advent of blockchain, decentralized data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way. Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.‚Äù*\n\nSebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI‚Äôs vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:\n\n*‚ÄúThe old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.‚Äù*\n\nThey'll be exploring this through Ocean Protocol, which is also a member of MOBI.""]"
