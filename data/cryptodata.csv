"You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1","You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1

You also don't hear about the guys who put $10,000 but cant cash out because these memecoins have no liquidity.

Don't beat yourself up for missing out.

Minance Exchange,"# $MBNB - Presale of Minance Exchange token MBNB on friday 30-07-2021 at 20UTC  - ðŸš€ You earn from every trade on our exchange - one Token to rule them all....

Softcap : 400bnb - Hardcap : 1000 bnb.

Max supply 34.5M - unsold will never be minted.

1bnb = 30.000 MBNB - + 30% bonus to the first (100bnb worth sold)

NO dev wallet - NO team wallet - 1 wallet for PCS liquidity (3M MBNB)

We sell through SmartContract on our homepage [Minance.org](https://Minance.org) \- video description and guide available on website.

We aim to be the bridge between Swaps and Binance - we think in big volume, many tokens, huge hype and marketing ALL the time.

Lets tell you how our bonus program works -Every trade on our exchange has a 0.1% fee - half of that goes to the MBNB holders on a regularly basis. If we reach just 1/1000 size of Binance - you will double your investment back every 3rd day and that dont include the increase of the MBNB. ðŸš€ HOW AWESOME IS THAT ðŸš€

We will list on PCS just 3 days after HC is reached - just to give you a chance to trade.We will add 100 bnb and 3M MBNB to PCS as liqudity. That is the only wallet with MBNB we have.

Exchange will be ready just 4 weeks after HC is reached.

**ðŸ’Ž Do you agree that this is 1000x potential ?**
